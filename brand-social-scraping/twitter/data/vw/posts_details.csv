https://x.com/VW/status/1895483896835502153,"Good morning, I apologize for the delay in response. I am still waiting for an update in regards to your initial inquiry about the manual for your vehicle. As far as the myVW app feature for the ID.4, our electric vehicle (EV) models are built with a different vehicle architecture. Because of these hardware and software differences, the EV models won’t have like-for-like functionality compared to ICE models. The models between 2020-2024 were not built with the 5.0 software. If your ID.4 has software version 5.0 or higher, door locking and unlocking via the myVW app is possible. For vehicles with earlier software versions, the app will display the door status (locked or unlocked) but can't perform remote locking or unlocking. I will check to see if the model year 2025 will have this software. 

If you are having concerns with the app for your Atlas Cross Sport, you will need to contact the Response team for any assistance with troubleshooting. Their phone number is 1 (833) 648-2735.

I am sorry to hear you are having issues with your screen going black, I am not sure if the update was for that specifically or if that is the reason or cause, I recommend contacting your VW dealer to look further into that concern for you, since they are our mechanical experts. 

As soon as I have an update in regards to your initial inquiry, I will follow up.
