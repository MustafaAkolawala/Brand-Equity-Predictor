Gosciniak, who works in prototype parts management, brought his heavily modified Chrome Yellow 1998 Mustang Cobra convertible for the crowd of over 1,500 employees and members of the public to admire.  Over 300 people brought vehicles for display with Mustangs being the predominant vehicles, though Broncos, Thunderbirds, and other Ford-built classics were part of the event. There was also a selection of vehicles from the recently announced Ford Heritage Fleet, a curated collection of nearly 500 vehicles globally showcasing the company’s legacy.  Gosciniak enjoyed seeing the Ford GTs that were part of the display – he worked on the HVAC vents for the prototype program. He said Ford can use learnings from vehicles in the fleet to help track customer trends.  “It’s super cool to see so many folks of all kinds of different ages coming out, showcasing our products, and it’s super cool to see new and old coming together,” said Jeff Waraniak, a strategic communications employee. “Ford does a great job of embracing the car community.”  Ford Heritage and Brand Manager Ted Ryan also saw the event as a way to get more employees and the public to engage with the Heritage Fleet.  “The thing I’ve loved is inside the garage where people are seeing the concepts,” he said. “Just everybody's stopping and taking pictures. That's why we do this – we’re car people.”  Do you believe cars can bring people together?

Recent Global Brand Merchandising and Licensing hire Jacqueline F. is part of the team that makes it easy to find and purchase fresh new Ford merchandise online: http://spr.ly/6049N8OPl  The assistant e-commerce marketing specialist is excited to give customers the best experience possible when they browse for items designed for the Ford fandom. “I chose to join Ford because it has a wealth of opportunities for professional growth and development, and it’s a company that leads with innovation,” says Jacqueline. “For example, I had always wanted to learn how to code html and CSS and Ford has already given me access to classes to acquire that skill.”  If Jacqueline looks familiar to you, it may be because you’ve seen her before -- she acts and models in commercials in her spare time! As if that’s not enough, the recent MBA grad runs about 25 miles weekly and has completed 27 5K races. Her proudest running achievement so far is having her name engraved in a metro park walkway for a first-place win. She’s says she’s grateful that Ford’s commitment to work-life balance helps her pursue her interests outside of work.  Welcome, Jacqueline!

He said that what caught his attention during the interview process was Ford’s commitment to family. His first impression was quickly proven correct.  “We had our fifth child soon after I started at Ford. I was shocked with how much paternity leave was provided so soon after my hire. Not only that, but I was worried about backlash since I was still new to the position, but my people leader and supervisors were thrilled for me. They insisted that I take the time my family needed to adjust to our new baby.”  As a high-voltage build & test engineer for electric vehicles, Alexander says his work is both challenging and engaging, which helps him feel like he’s “truly making a difference.”  The engineer and dad will soon be able to add “published author” to his resume. While working on papers for technical journals, he discovered how much he enjoyed the writing process, so the lifelong science fiction and fantasy reader began to write for fun. His first fantasy and magical realism book will be coming out this fall.  Alexander knows coming to Ford was the right decision for his career and his family. “The culture here has been super welcoming and really has helped me to feel included and cared for. I love being able to work on cutting-edge and amazing technology and have the peace of mind that my family matters to Ford.”   Welcome, Alexander!

The senior exterior designer says, “I feel confident that I have the best job in the world. So much of that is due to the endlessly talented creatives and mentors around me. It’s been a fantastic 10 years so far!”  Dan grew up in southeast Wisconsin and says he had “no connections to the auto industry” but he always loved everything about cars, especially drawing them. He found Lawrence Technological University’s Transportation Design program, where he fell in love with the Motor City, interned at Ford, and joined the company after graduation.  He says he’s been lucky to have worked on a wide range of production and prototype projects – passenger vehicles, Ford Performance, graphics projects, concept builds and show vehicles. The highlight, though? “That has to be the Bronco R race prototype from 2021. Not only did we have only three months to design and build the vehicle from scratch to compete in the Baja 1000, but it would also be the first glimpse the world would see of the brand-new Ford Bronco that we had cooking. The team talent and collaboration made it one of those once-in-a-career experiences that I’ll never forget.”  Dan loves being part of Team Bronco, but he’s particularly passionate about the Bronco Sport. “I’d argue that ripping around in the Bronco Sport Sasquatch is the some of the most fun you can have in a Bronco, period.”  Find out more about the design behind the Ford Bronco Sport Sasquatch edition with Dan and his Ford Design colleague, color and material design manager Kellie Walters.

The motorsports powertrain design engineer comes from a long line of auto mechanics who owned a family auto repair shop and his dad and uncles worked in professional auto racing.  “I’ve been obsessed with fast cars and competition from a young age,” Kyle says. “It wasn’t until my undergrad years of college in mechanical engineering, when I joined University of North Carolina-Charlotte’s Formula SAE team, that I really began to discover my love of designing components from a clean sheet.”  He interfaced with his Ford Performance co-workers and supervisor as part of his previous job and that gave him some insight into the culture, but he says it’s been even better than expected. “The close-knit team and collaboration of everyone within Ford Performance has been amazing. My first week, Mark Rushbrook and Patrick DiMarco shook my hand, asked if I was Kyle, and introduced themselves before I even had a chance to tell them who I was. That showed me how much they care about the people working here.”  Kyle is excited about the variety of projects he’ll be working on. He’ll be helping develop and evolve the engine platforms for things as varied as GT3 and LMDh road racing, 410 sprint cars for dirt ovals, Dakar Raptor T1+ and other Bronco and Ranger Raptor programs for off-road, and more. As a newlywed, he’s also excited about gaining benefits like family-building assistance and more vacation time for better work-life balance.  Welcome to the team, Kyle!

From my first experience with my recruiter to meeting my hiring manager and leadership, it was clear to me that the culture at Ford was positive, motivational and transparent.”  Candice recently joined Ford Pro as a digital experience specialist, which means she’s managing the way North American customers interact with the Ford Pro website. She’ll be collaborating across organizations to ensure customers can find everything they need and more on the site, like vehicle launches, software, charging, service, and product financing.  She calls her career transition a “big leap” from the digital marketing and customer experience side of the real estate industry to the automotive industry but says she’s excited by the opportunities to learn and grow. “It’s fascinating to see how much research, development, and collaboration time goes into producing our vehicles. I’m not what you’d call a ‘car girl’ but after just a few months, I’m learning the lingo and starting to feel like a true pro!”  The emphasis on work-life balance and flexibility was also “a real plus” for Candice, as she and her high-school-sweetheart-turned-partner DeMarcus are new parents to six-month-old Aubrey. She says she also likes that paid volunteer hours allow her to make a difference and contribute to the community as part of her job.  “The team at Ford couldn’t have made the transition easier or more seamless. The people here are beyond brilliant and I'm so happy to be working alongside them.”   Welcome, Candice!  Looking to apply your expertise to a new industry like Candice?

After relocating to another state and having children, she is thrilled to be back “engaging with former colleagues, using my expertise and working remotely, which provides a great work-life balance. My team is full of incredibly smart people to learn from, too.”  Emily is part of the Integrated Services team’s efforts to share all the great benefits customers can gain by downloading the Ford Pass and Lincoln Way apps. “I've been able to jump back in and apply my Ford-based knowledge, while learning something new and fresh about apps and the technology we offer. I’m also encouraged to see the use of AI and new ways of working that didn’t exist during my last tenure here. It's been fun, new and familiar at the same time!”  Emily calls herself “a Ford girl through and through”—her grandfather worked for Ford and her husband’s parents met on the assembly line in Wixom. “Our family was quite literally created from the blue oval in a sense, and I’m honored that I can add my chapter to our Ford story.”  As any parent knows, spare time is rare, but she has managed to pick up a hobby recently. As a new DIY enthusiast, she has accumulated a collection of power tools, saws and other equipment and is busy transforming her family’s home into their dream space (check out her handiwork in the pictures.) Next project: finishing the basement!  Whether you’re re-entering the workforce or looking for a new challenge, you can start your next chapter at Ford.

When he joined Ford he had no idea that one day he’d be working at the newly remodeled Michigan Central Station, a historical building with family ties. His wife’s grandfather worked at the train station for the railroad company doing pre-computer era analysis, tracking data for the company. Morton also recently learned that as a child his mother traveled through the station to San Francisco to meet up with her father, who had been deployed to Japan with the Army in the 1950s.  He has also forged another connection on his own. In 2023, Morton created a nonprofit, Elevate, aimed at bringing stability and flexibility of transportation to Detroiters. Created at The Factory, Ford’s office space just down the road from Michigan Central in Corktown, the organization offers older model Ford vehicles on an all-inclusive subscription basis. Elevate was acquired by another nonprofit organization, Feonix – Mobility Rising, which operates out of the Book Depository building in the Michigan Central complex.  Morton says Ford went above and beyond in its redevelopment project, and believes the refurbished building, its location, and the collaborative nature of Michigan Central may help Ford attract new talent at a time when the city is being shaped into a tech and innovation hub. “The fact that we're open and embracing new ideas, new people, and new entrepreneurs who can challenge us, I think that's only going to make us stronger.”  Morton has felt a kinship with native Detroiters since returning to the area and feels privileged to be working there. He also looks forward to area amenities, such as the RiverWalk. “To see Michigan Central Station and the whole Corktown community makes me really proud of Michigan, the city, and Ford. It’s really cool to be able to work there.”  Would you like to work at a company that values the best of the past and uses it to transform the future?

His great-grandfather worked in the ticket office when the train station opened in 1913, and was employed there until he departed for World War I with his brother Milo in 1917.  “Having not even grown up in Michigan, what are the odds? My great-grandfather worked in the building when it opened over 100 years ago, and I’m working there as it reopens. It makes you wonder about fate or a plan for the universe,” said Rockwell, who now resides in Northville, Michigan.  Beyond his family ties to the building, Brian said being located at Michigan Central is going to be great for Integrated Services, which is driving innovation for the company and will be able to take advantage of the collaborative environment there.  “Everybody's really excited about it for a lot of different reasons,” he said. “There's a lot of excitement about the building itself and its history, but also about being in Corktown, which is such a lively area,” noting the nearby Ford office locations and restaurants.  Rockwell also said he thinks of Integrated Services’ move from Ford’s World Headquarters to Michigan Central symbolizes the transformation taking place at Ford and within the automotive industry and helps solidify the team as an innovation hub for the company. Although he’s not a native Detroiter, Rockwell has always had a soft spot for the automotive business. “The things that we do here have a huge impact on people's lives,” he said.

Bill Ford’s vision for Michigan Central was informed by an understanding that the intersection of different ideas and perspectives drive innovation, and success in the industry requires an open platform where companies and sectors collaborate – even competitors.  Michigan Central will bring Ford employees from Model e and Integrated Services together with Ford Pro and others – and when needed, external partners, entrepreneurs, students, and community members – to co-create new products, services, and technologies that add value to a new generation of Ford customers and help build a better world. While Ford’s investment is crucial to the company’s long-term planning, it also represents a commitment to the city of Detroit and its future, becoming a beacon of development and opportunity.

The program provided essential infrastructure, technology systems, area improvement, and life skill workshops, each tailored to the specific needs of three schools in Chonburi and Rayong provinces. Over 150 volunteers, including Ford employees from Bangkok, Ford Thailand Manufacturing (FTM), AutoAlliance Thailand (AAT), Ford Ek Group dealership and private sector partners, helped make a positive impact.  In collaboration with partners like WHA Corporation Public Company Limited, Prime Power Company Limited, and R 1-2 Thai Engineering Company Limited, the volunteers joined in delivering equipment, installing a 5-kiowatt solar roof system, water filtration systems, rebuilding playgrounds, installing restrooms and fences and other projects.  Thanks to the hard-working volunteers who made these schools safe, energy-efficient and beautiful places to learn!
