Ford Motor Company will you be in Virginia recruiting?
Love this
"Would like to know regarding this even as it has a platform for an individual to grow. I am eager to find out if a person joins to the event, are there links to sign on and join via social portal. Due to financial difficulties this is based out of region and I am located in Jhb area.

- Battle Creek seems like an interesting event but unfortunately I do not have the financial to attend such event even if I wanted to. As i am interested in growing in the industrial mechanic/ perhaps beginner start at general maintenance/ do have a background of warehousing -SAP knowledge/SAPME knowledge which is more of an instrumental portal. I’m eager to  learn or study given the opportunity to do so. I am a father of two and my interest is in becoming skilled in the fields mentioned and expanding within the company. Please advise…. Stay blessed and well done to the progress in ford and their leaders interesting stories to read and follow on but time to set dream or passion in to practice and in future wish to join such brilliant facility to grow and make the best of developing myself as and individual."

"Dear friends at Ford Motor Company:

I have an exceptional idea to help bolster sales. Please consider re-starting the third generation Fox platform for the Mustang. With a twist: modify the engine mounts to allow for 302/351, to 4.6/5.4, 5.0/5.2 Coyote or 427 to the 7.3 Godzilla system. As for the transmission any Ford from the top loader, five or six speed World Class/Tremec, or C4 and the rear end in 8.8 in either live axle or independent rear suspension. The nine inch would be a great option for folks looking for a drag car or Pro-Street.

Think about it. The aftermarket is already flooded with parts for the car. You could sell them as a ""roller platform"", no engine or transmission. 

It is just my $.02 worth, but as a prior drag racer, and lifetime Ford gearhead, ""who loves the 5.0 Fox Coupe"" I thought you all may be looking for ideas."

"Ford Warranty Denied — Despite Meeting Every Single Criteria

I never thought I’d be here, but I feel obligated to share this with my network — especially other Ford owners.

My 2018 Ford Escape (6 years old, 78k miles) began running rough and blowing white smoke. Diagnostics showed a cylinder misfire (code P0301), and my mechanic confirmed coolant intrusion — exactly what Ford’s own Customer Satisfaction Program 21N12 covers.

Ford’s letter states:
➡️ White smoke
➡️ Codes P0300–P0304
➡️ Coolant intrusion
➡️ Coverage up to 7 years or 84,000 miles

My car meets ALL these criteria. Yet, the dealer quoted me $14,000 to fix it and denied coverage.

Worse:

Multiple calls to Ford’s customer service — no real help.
The Ford agent listed in their own letter? Promised to call back… never did.
Another agent even admitted the dealer might be “taking advantage.”
I’ve filed a formal complaint with the FTC and I’m prepared to take this further legally.

If you’ve experienced something similar with Ford or any other automaker, I’d appreciate you sharing your experience in the comments. Let’s bring more visibility to these practices."

"Introduction of Patented Fuel-Saving Device for Commercial Use

Dear Ford Community and Management Team,

I am writing to introduce a patented fuel-saving device I have designed and tested extensively. This innovative system has been trialed on a Volvo-brand semi-truck operating in long-haul conditions with a full 50-ton load.

The results have demonstrated significant improvements in fuel efficiency and engine performance, making it a strong candidate for integration into commercial transport fleets such as yours.

I would welcome the opportunity to present the full technical details and discuss how this solution could contribute to Ford’s sustainability and cost-saving goals."

"Some of my favorite memories from my time at Ford were the volunteer opportunities.

I had the chance to help out at Michigan Central when it opened, at Forgotten Harvest, and at a few other incredible places I’ll never forget.
Volunteering really showed me how Ford’s impact goes far beyond the vehicles — it’s about building communities, supporting people, and making a real difference.

Proud to have been part of it — and proud to always carry that Ford spirit with me. #WeAreFord #FordPhilanthropy"

"Hoje faz exatamente 1 mês e dois dias que meu carro foi imobilizado na Caoa Jabaquara, para avaliação de barulhos na parte dianteira, fraco desempenho, problemas no SYNC e defeito no ar-condicionado. 

Novamente, reforçando o que disse anteriormente, problemas esses que surgiram após o carro ficar 2 meses imobilizado para reparo na transmissão, entre dezembro do ano passado e fevereiro deste ano. 

E a Ford está querendo me forçar a aceitar uma “cortesia” apenas do TCM. Algo, no mínimo, questionável. Pois o veículo não apresentava todos esses problemas quando deu entrada na concessionária, em dezembro. Os problemas surgiram em menos de 30 dias que eu tirei o carro da oficina. 

Reforço aqui, por favor, para que meu problema seja solucionado o quanto antes junto à Ford e Concessionária. 

Aguardo retorno da empresa."
Big congrats 🎉
does it have a solar panel connected to alternator or the other equipment it has in truck?.....that'd be cool though right
It's a great experience. We did ours just outside of Vegas. We had a blast!!
"This is brilliant.  I can testify to the level of engagement and connectivity based on a similar experience with my Ford purchase.  When I purchased my 2020 Ford Edge ST, it came with a customer experience in North Carolina at a track to experience all of the SUV’s features.  I took my Dad with me to experience it.  Needless to say, I made friends who were all ST model owners, and I’ve now owned over five Ford vehicles.  Kudos to Ford for incredible customer experiences."
Great
A great example of how fresh ideas—when nurtured—can grow into impactful brand experiences. Encouraging to see internship programs that truly empower young talent to drive real change. Congrats to the team behind Bronco OffRoadeo and the new interns starting their journeys!

"Inspiring story that highlights the power of customer-centric innovation and the impact interns can make when given real responsibility and trust. Turning deep user empathy into a thriving, community-driven experience like Bronco Off-Roadeo shows what happens when bold ideas meet thoughtful execution. Kudos to Stephanie Simon, Travis Bouchard, and the Ford Motor Company team for transforming passion into lasting connections — and for setting a great example of how immersive brand experiences can drive loyalty and advocacy."

You can create a iconic car but you can‘t re-create one. There is only one Ford Capri.
"""Germany"""
"In 1995, was in Munich,  traveling to Austria,  Czech Republic,  Hungary.  A guy asked me what I was driving in the States. I told him, a Ford Escort.  He looked at me like I had a Sports car.  Later I found out that the Escort made for the German Market had a V-6 engine!!! Wow! That would fly on the Autobahn!  Lol...The Escort & Capri were related."
"This is just next-level cool. Blending iconic legacy with future-forward design like this is exactly why Ford continues to lead with both vision and authenticity. Massive respect to the team behind the new Capri—this is how you honor the past and reimagine what’s possible. 🔥

"This is incredible. Ford’s legacy of service goes far beyond the assembly line — from Model T ambulances in WWI to blood drives and disaster relief today, it’s been part of what makes the company truly American. Love seeing that tradition of giving carried forward through Ford Philanthropy and the Red Cross. 🇺🇸💙 #FordHistory #CommunityDriven #Heritage"
"Ford is a great Company, thanks for your support to the American Red Cross."
Wayne county is going get the fuck out of myself Wayne county commissioner
"I am incredibly grateful for Ford Philanthropy’s unwavering support in helping the American Red Cross respond to disasters, collect lifesaving blood, serve communities in need and more. Ford's generosity during Red Cross Month makes an even greater impact! Together, we are providing hope when it’s needed most. Thank you for standing with us—every donation and volunteer hour truly makes a difference!"
"The Red Cross movement does vital work across the globe, so seeing this kind of major support is amazing!"
😘😘😘😘😘
"Red Cross is the real deal. I saw and experienced the support of this awesome organization when my Mother's house burned down and I lost my brother in that fire. They were there holding our hands and guiding us through the recovery process. Amazing, amazing organization. ❤️"
I Love Ford ❤️💙❤️

Wow! Ford is truly pushing the boundaries of EV performance. Excited to see how this innovation shapes the EV landscape.
"-I thought I bought a Ford Escape Plug-in hybrid.

-I ended up with a Ford Escape Plug-in hybrid that I can't PLUG-IN!
PLUS!!!

-A malfunctioning battery that can cause loss of motive power, increasing the risk of crash, and that could cause the vehicle to catch on fire.

Thank you Ford"
"Impressive performance by the Mustang Mach-E Rally! It's exciting to see Ford pushing the boundaries of electric vehicles with rally-inspired design and capabilities. The positive reviews are well-deserved, and it's clear this vehicle is a true game-changer in both performance and innovation. Looking forward to seeing how it continues to set new standards
"
Wrong.untill the car enters a real race against top competition the car is not a rally car.any jackass can throw rally tires on a wagon and call it a rally car.just like Tesla trying to set the fastest lap and the car never made it around the track.you are nothing untill you can be equal to the cars that are already proven themselves.no offense ford you lost your touch in the past 20yrs.the mustangs have always been you bread and butter everything else has been whatever.the reason the older gt40 was so epic was because it was brilliantly simple.

Ford should have named this the new Edge Mach E. Naming it a mustang and not being a sports car was the biggest marketing mistake they made. Now people hate it because it shares the name when its not a bad car. If you get in one and pretend its a newer gen electric Ford Edge people would be more inclined towards it. Fords marketing team really missed the ball with this opportunity because the edge isnt even in production anymore
Scca RallyCross is a absolute blast. Find your local region to get involved in the fun!
🏁🏁🏁
"From proving grounds to podiums, the Mach-E Rally is showing the world what EV performance really looks like. This isn’t just a bold design—it’s a statement backed by engineering, grit, and track-tested results. Huge props to the team for taking it way beyond the “sticker package” and into true rally territory.

That's fantastic  congratulations . How about  setting  Ford above and beyond  any of your competitors.

Now why am I choosing  to got about it this way cause if I had the money I'd pay for one to be built but I don't. This truck is Superior. I'm not some crazy  Is deranged fan or mentally ill individual  thinking I have all mankind's answer but I think I have an excellent answer to one of or life's existence  so pls get in touch with me  thank you

"Jim Farley—Lifelong Ford enthusiast. Not to brag but we actively have five Ford vehicles. Our history goes deep with my father pulling a model A from a field so he was able to drive himself to school. 

As a child, my father was influential, so much so, my vehicle choices lean towards the Ford line. 

I only wish our family could experience the new electric line of vehicles.  

For the record; I'd be willing to provide we weekly update to tell the world how cool the vehicles are. 

Not kidding.

"Happy Rivian driver here. Cross country trip was great, level 1 charging at home for super cheap, lots of moving truck expenses averted, no issues with cold weather charging (just remember to set the mirrors to stay out when freezing ice rains!)"
I live in a cold weather climate and recently read in AutoGuide.com that the average EV loses 20% of its range in cold temps with the best performers having a heat pump and losing an average of 17% of their range (Tesla Model Y only loses 14%). The Mustang Mach-E was listed as the 2nd worst performer losing 34% of its range. Are there any plans to add a heat pump and/or improve this performance for cold weather climates?
Congrats! 🎉🍾🎊🎈
Mine has been in the shop almost as much as it has been in my garage.  
Any idea when the Mach-E will support two way charging like the Lightening?

"Interesting article ,more photos of where he went etc? would be better, but i am bent / 8 Man , and Henery Ford , person served my time as apprentice at Ford Dealership Australia in 1948 .
Electricity rates tripled in five years, still rising, not many charging stations in this country,
but will test one out in land down under if you require ,150 series would be better i could take generator with me just in case ? 😎 "
"Vandals and metal thieves have been cutting off charger cables.  The charging station should be designed to retract the cable into a compartment that only opens when a customer inserts a credit card or driver's license, which is returned when the cable is safely back in the compartment."
Robert is a fantastic EV advocate and a true asset to Ford!!!

This was a wrong way driver head-on impact at 200mph.  My wife walked away and after some medical attention on my 5 crushed vertebrae, broken arm, 3 broken ribs, broken leg, so did I... the truck was barrel rolled and the other driver died on impact.

Ford have a lot of bossy narcissist managers that give orders and demand the employees to do the work as dictated; there are great engineers in Ford but they can't put in practice their creativity and develop their potential because these managers don't understand what management modesty can do in a work environment. Most of the HR employees in Ford just follow the orders of these egocentric narcissist managers. It is time for Ford to stop hiding and doing makeup of the red numbers and renew itself to be a great company again.
This is a good one! Great men and women of Ford's manufacturing team.

"I believe some companies need to be careful with how they release new E.V. vehicles. Not saying they aren’t great. However, I really believe Ford would do great if they released a replacement concept of a V8 RWD. Especially since the sedan market that has been left open by other competitors removal of v8 sedans. Especially with the new 5.0 v8 updated engine. Probably wouldn’t be a bad fleet/ service car. Maybe offer a 7.3 gas option. Offer a couple engine options restore a retired name plate. The rest would be absolute history. Maybe even an upgraded forced induction persuit model could be offered to allow openings to the various markets. From my experience and knowledge of police and consumers. This maybe something Ford should consider."

"hello  I hope that my proposal will be seen by the #production #manager and #owner of Ford Company and engineers or consultants.  In the new product line of your car, place 4 light pneumatic jack with a square base on the chassis next to each wheel, which is controlled by four keys in one.  The box inside the cabin can be controlled with a password so that when necessary on the roads or in public places, the wheel can be changed easily, especially for women, and in other places by placing all four jacks on the ground, easy and simple theft of cars by thieves can be prevented.    Artificial intelligence gave this idea and my suggestion a score of 9 out of 10.  thank you"

"Did you know it’s better to charge them outside 


because they can burn down the house if you do it inside the garage"
"After 45k miles, I have charged my car two times outside of my garage.   Chemistry is more important than infrastructure. I don't want to stop to fill up. I want to fill up at the hotel. Give me 600 miles with the heat on and we can put ICE in the history books. "

"My 2006 F-150 is so simple that when I wanted to change the interior air filter, found out it didn't have one. 

Got a lot of engine knocking when I bought it new so went to a thicker oil once it got past the 36,000 warranty and now have over 200,000 miles on her. 

But otherwise, she is a beast. Paint finish is still great and not peeling like a few other OEMs. Repair parts are easy to get, even on Amazon can find a replacement pull out cup holder.

I remember at Nissan we had a quick turnaround for bumpers to the body shop. But this changed when Carlos came.

Some other OEMs you have to wait a month to four months to get the repair parts from China.

Only drawback on the electric cars up North is wanting to plug them in up in the winter."
"Why do you forget Germany and bidirectional charging, that is the enabler for electric vehicles. 
We all need the support in Winter."
"Ford can’t give the EVs away.  Check out the incentives.  They said they’ll invest $30 billion in EV initiatives. They’ve walk way back from that

Worst run large company in US"
"Our Ford vehicle that we bought for my girlfriend 20 days ago broke down and we had to take a tow truck because it could not run; however, leaving our surprise aside, what really shocked us was that the spark plug of the vehicle had broken down and the part was not available in Turkey, it would have to be brought from abroad. According to the service, this would take more than a month. Now we are servicing our vehicle that should be servicing us; don't you think there is a contradiction and disgrace in this?"
"I would greatly appreciate a response concerning my 2022 Ford Lightning that’s has been out of service and at my local Ford dealer since April 17th, 2024. I have explored almost every option except arbitration. Ford Motor Company may I please get a response for start and a resolution to this? I have documentation and a case number. Thanks a bunch."
The extension of Ford's Power Promise complimentary home charger and standard installation into 2025 is a strong commitment to making electric vehicle (EV) ownership more convenient and accessible.
"EV’s are only useful in a big city, granted you have the luxury of owning a car while living in the city. Everywhere else in the world EV’s are unrealistic and obsolete. Facts."
"Ford Power Promise would definitely help in EV adoption.  Home charging, range anxiety, and ongoing support are valid pain points. Right consumer targeting based on travel type would help embrace sustainable mobility."

In a few months, they’ll be crying about how the Chinese are playing unfairly (which, to be fair, they sometimes do—just like everyone else).
It’s time to get back to the streets, listen to your customers, and make us dream again!
P.S. The US have a competitive advantage that European or Japanese ones lack: you’re great at software. Let’s face it—OEMs, in general, are terrible at software design and development. You can here beat China if you dare.

"As one of the first to get a Mach-E in our area (and lost our behind on the deal unfortunately after prices crashed), we have explained to countless people how and why electric made sense for us as we live in a smaller metro area. I’m glad yo see the home charger added as part of the deal now.

I believe the government’s stance on pushing toward EVs hurt the market as US citizens hate having choices taken away.  Also, so many folks assume that if you drive an EV you’re trying to “save the world” rather than just trying to avoid the gas station 😆"

"I’m sure the Ford dealer, told you it was a used Electric Mustang, and also offered you warranty to cover repairs for your car, and updates only happen when there are updates. The best way to describe this situation is, I’m sure many of you have Medical insurance, because when you get sick, you need help to pay for your body break down or sickness. So the warranty is like medical insurance for your car. These modern cars are very hard to repair and fix with out a car doctor or your local Ford Machanic. And nothing last forever, not even Ford cars. So the money you saved on buying a used car, use that to pay for your repairs. Next time buy medical warranty for your car, it’s the second most expensive product to purchase. Be safe buy your car and truck warranties to save your self some money. GO. FORD!!!"

"Our Ford vehicle that we bought for my girlfriend 20 days ago broke down and we had to take a tow truck because it could not run; however, leaving our surprise aside, what really shocked us was that the spark plug of the vehicle had broken down and the part was not available in Turkey, it would have to be brought from abroad. According to the service, this would take more than a month. Now we are servicing our vehicle that should be servicing us; don't you think there is a contradiction and disgrace in this?"

"It's refreshing to see a car company so invested in community gardening rather than just horsepower.
Keep revving up those green efforts!"

"It’s inspiring to see Ford taking meaningful steps toward sustainability and working hand-in-hand with local communities. Protecting the environment is a shared responsibility, and with industries contributing over 24% of global CO₂ emissions and freshwater resources under growing pressure, these efforts couldn’t be more important. Goals like using 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035 and partnering with grassroots organizations show how impactful local actions can become when supported by larger players. Ford’s approach reminds us that when businesses and communities work together, the results are not just sustainable but deeply meaningful."

https://on.soundcloud.com/bRJHTQWb3DLNcqNF8


The philosopher of civil disobedience and natural simplicity, Henry David Thoreau lived from 1817 to 1862, during which time the following U.S. presidents held office:

1. James Monroe (1817–1825)


2. John Quincy Adams (1825–1829)


3. Andrew Jackson (1829–1837)


4. Martin Van Buren (1837–1841)


5. William Henry Harrison (1841)


6. John Tyler (1841–1845)


7. James K. Polk (1845–1849)


8. Zachary Taylor (1849–1850)


9. Millard Fillmore (1850–1853)


10. Franklin Pierce (1853–1857)


11. James Buchanan (1857–1861)


12. Abraham Lincoln (1861–1865; Thoreau died during Lincoln's presidency).



Let me know if you'd like more context about his interactions with any of these presidencies!

I am the most precise driver on the planet, or could given such fourm to be a precision driver. 


Thank you,

John"
Congratulations! Taking great steps
"Dear Mr. Ford — I’m shopping around for a new vehicle— I can’t find anything in your lineup—-I don’t want CVT transmission. I don’t want cylinder deactivation. I don’t want electric and I can’t stand turbos.

I’m OK with hybrid — with a naturally aspirated engine 

Please help"
Shame the company never had such noble aspirations when it allowed the Germans to shut the British operations down devastating communities in the UK.
"In Saarlois Deutschland ist eine moderne Fertigungsstrasse von FORD und Kurzarbeit.Da könnte man einen E-Ford für einen schmalen Taler produzieren und dem Wettbewerb zeigen, dass es auch in Deutschland noch Innovation gibt. ...warum in die Ferne schweifen...."

"I think everyone understands that if you create a post about this subject- there’s only one way you can positively present it. I’m also sure it’s widely understood that anyone CREATING a SM post under the logo of such an iconic name as ‘FORD’ would likely be relatively new to that organization and savvy in regards to : analytics, algorithms… all that stuff. Where I think the disconnect occurs is when ‘new blood’ preaches ‘old school’ values. The ‘true’ history of FORD-it’s original owners- THIER beliefs, morals and values do not -in the majority of this claim- match the message you’re trying to convey. Granted- it’s a new day/ things change- but even today, with the blatant, obvious-outrageous corporate greed that is ironically transparent at FORD-in direct contrast to the quality product produced- cancells out any thought of ‘good neighbor’ or ‘environmental concern’ that any FORD post will EVER be able to sale as authentic"
Ford should do this simple route : https://www.hydrogentrucker.com/CARB/2024.html
Well done but no receives anything from please help me with some money to growing up my work shop please

Well done! It is unfortunate that you have to organize cleanup efforts to remove trash from our world because a few don’t care about the environment and disposing of trash properly.
"Wow- all of that and you manufacture an excellent product! I’m proud to be diving a Ford EV and supporting your company’s efforts, keep up the good work!🌎"

"My folks have a cat, 3 times it's accidently bit theme, twice with sepsis. The cat must be an indoor cat away from the chance to cat rats and therefore have similar bacteria in its mouth. GOSH when instructing us what to be careful from, due to my sons autoimmune disorder, stated our dog is fine ( although Jack Russel rat hunters have bacterial issues too) but to stay away from cats.  I've just stated facts here on personal experience and risks mention by NHS specialists on Bio hazards of outdoor cats, to add to an informed decision. I'd rather be offered a safer dog therapy if had the choice, especially as they are labelled man's best friend ( obviously women too and the other 98 genders). "

"This is not always the position my cat Facy is in, he's usually sleeping next to my lap top on my paper notes. He actually helps me stay focused, monitoring my work and sometimes makes comments to help or correct me when I'm in a Teams meeting."
Now I understand why you can't get BlueCruise updates out on time. Maybe a little less play time with your cats and a little more actual work time would be a nice consideration for your customers that just signed up for a 7 year obligation to pay $2000 a month.   You'd think that if you are asking your middle class customers to plop down a small fortune for a truck you'd actually deliver on updates when you promise.
Greetings from Finland. Here is my cat Rio with my Mustang GT and my other cat Elna with my previous Mustang.

That smug black cat is awesome!
So cute!
There are few things that compare to the comfort of having your bestie around for chin scritches and burying your face in a floofy belly. 💜🐈
Love this!
