More materials were being used in the safety structure, and there was more equipment, increasing the kerb weight to 915 kilogrammes. In terms of design, the car had taken a quantum leap forward. What was particularly striking on the new model was its rounder look, as well as the pronounced C-pillar and the raised rear end.  ‚ÑπÔ∏è In addition, modern safety systems such as driver and front passenger airbags, seat belt tensioners, and the anti-lock brake system had now appeared on the scene. For the first time in its model history, the Polo was also available as a five-door model, and as an estate from July 1997.   üèéÔ∏è In 1998 the Polo sported the three iconic letters more commonly associated with its ‚Äúbig brother‚Äù, the Golf, for the first time: the limited-edition Polo III GTI sold out quickly.  üöò In September 1999, the Polo was given another makeover: the new model had a redesigned front end, clear glass headlights, modified bumpers, redesigned tail light clusters, and a high-quality interior with blue backlit instruments. Two airbags and the anti-lock brake system were now fitted as standard, while ESC (Electronic Stability Control) was available as an optional feature.  #Volkswagen #Polo #Polo50",457,429,25,3,12,11,"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQHjL_PLceXXDA/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B4EZa0EW72HcAo-/0/1746777765050?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=cRyHKHvz9OLwalKu2eRnbLzDTpLE_es1WlM0D62vuJk, https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQFoOZL2hUFZzg/feedshare-shrink_1280/B4EZa0EW8DGQAk-/0/1746777764664?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=fMvSdc41r5-GSGXq71O8GSeeWJ0WE4QV0tWphX1aLYs, https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQFr8ky6PBpEOw/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B4EZa0EW8DHcAo-/0/1746777764738?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=6oO214BPGBf20NrmWSktq9CihYHcwN9wDNXO8tBtE3w, https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQHDh2392_V3SA/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B4EZa0EW8IHYAo-/0/1746777765169?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=4jF5Q0MT1uoyphnt4Bt-txDTFrTnR2Ad0mMEF6usojs"

Since 1996, the Kariega plant in the Eastern Cape has been the beating heart of Polo production. Over 1.9 million Polos and 440,000 Polo Vivos have rolled off its lines ‚Äì including every single Polo GTI in the world. Together with media guests and content creators, we explored the Kariega plant, convinced ourselves of the Polo‚Äòs racing qualities at Simola Hillclimb and experienced the comfort of our Polo on the long ride from Knysna to Cape Town.  üó∫Ô∏è The Polo has long been an international success story. Series production of the Polo I began in March 1975 at our headquarters in Wolfsburg. But as the model increased in importance, production was spread to other locations around the world, including Spain, Argentina, South Africa, Slovenia, China, Brazil and India. With more than 20 million units built, the Polo is one of the world‚Äôs most successful small compact vehicles.  ‚öôÔ∏è The Kariega plant, around 1,000 km south of Johannesburg, covers an area of 518,378 m2 (= 70 football pitches). In addition to the Polo and Polo Vivo, engines for the Polo Vivo are also produced there. With almost 4,000 employees, @VWGA is the largest private employer in the Nelson Mandela Bay metropolitan region, which includes Kariega.  #Volkswagen #Polo #Polo50",416,387,21,5,16,13,"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D22AQFMu6rWPZBs6Q/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B4DZakeprcG4As-/0/1746516223084?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=8hyC22B2bxuLoQtySaNilWT_Y2FS9KU3h_ooBrubv9k, https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D22AQENt0uomPENUw/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B4DZakeprZHwA8-/0/1746516222367?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=mn8WIO76Lqnn1txOekTXSLLLnZfraNxNgf3UET7-rgw, https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D22AQHraSpAWn_uIg/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B4DZakeprkGcAo-/0/1746516222988?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=3t3wXnCc5F2F3RM6HeOuz63IwIJH671dZ_Nf0QIby30, https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D22AQF1GF9s80AsAg/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B4DZakeprmG4As-/0/1746516222991?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=1e63bl62hj02CZt6LOJCc-GzVNRYrL9hbRa5ctUNRSg"

I grew up with the VW Polo,‚Äô explains Geoffroy Thirion with a smile.  üèÜ¬†The Belgian was ""infected"" as a teenager: his uncle competed in hill climbs and was crowned Belgian champion multiple times. Geoffroy was always part of the action and was allowed to work on the hill climb Polo. ‚ÄòThat's when I developed my passion for the VW Polo, mechanics and racing.‚Äô These days Geoffroy also competes in hill climbs and is currently building a Polo 16V ‚ÄòHill Climb Cup‚Äô version.  üöò¬†But he also has a soft spot for rare first-generation Polo; he owns a Polo I RX from 1978, the last of a Belgian limited edition of just 1,000 units. It is his Mars Red dream car ‚Äì he dreamed of this RX version even as a child because it was like a ‚ÄòMini Golf GTI‚Äô.  üåç¬†His Polo I GLS in Diamond Silver is a UK import ‚Äì and the only one in Belgium. Geoffroy and the right-hand drive car are of the same vintage ‚Äì 1979. For trips, fan meetings and exhibitions, he is also using his Senegal Red Polo I L from Sweden: Only 24,000 kilometres on the clock and built in Wolfsburg in December 1975, it is the oldest car in his collection.  ‚õ∞Ô∏è¬†Finally, there is the Belgian 1977 Polo L ‚ÄòCorgi‚Äô in Bronze Metallic. Much revised since 2000, including a 1.3-litre engine from a Polo II GT under the bonnet, it is equipped for historic Belgian hill climbs.  ‚òÄÔ∏è¬†And true Polo enthusiasts love spending time with like-minded people. Which is why Geoffroy founded the fan club ‚ÄòTyp86.be‚Äô in 2015.

The VW Polo had been doing well for two years, but why not offer a variant for those needing a little more space?   üß≥ The Derby is a Polo with a notchback, but with its own character. With an impressive 515 litres of boot space, the VW Derby I was the perfect choice for anyone looking to combine compactness with everyday practicality.   üå¥ Whether it's a week's shopping or luggage for holidays, the Derby packs in more than seemingly possible. Comfort and a certain elegance, plus advanced VW technology and engines with 29 kW (40 PS), 37 kW (50 PS) or 44 kW (60 PS) make it a reliable companion in cities and the countryside. ‚Äç  üöó A facelift in 1979 sharpened its appearance. The second series of the Derby was launched at the same time as the Polo II in 1981. Despite its qualities, the Derby lead a rather quiet existence. In January 1985, it returned to the original family and was absorbed into the Polo II notchback.   üòé Today, the Derby is a real rarity on the roads ‚Äì a classic showing that practicality and style need not be a contradiction in terms.   #Volkswagen #Derby #Polo50 #CoolClassics",616,564,38,12,17,21,"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D22AQH5cSuELJoISA/feedshare-shrink_1280/B4DZZr_5VjG4Ao-/0/1745568634668?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=5C3T9WkzzVWJFhm33MjkegbakODPQkSkvwZgIIoktgk, https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D22AQGv78TZ6JJx5A/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B4DZZr_5URHIAs-/0/1745568634612?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=mKe49q11uyjjVrCa8owLF9_moFBdJOjThcDdcBsHFIk, https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D22AQF6U2jzEHWZwg/feedshare-shrink_1280/B4DZZr_5VfG0Ak-/0/1745568634641?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=lmqNhA_-euw6t8AZs8nZ1daASBVnmfTnpAAOXqHt8uw, https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D22AQE6CyhRy0IVaQ/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B4DZZr_5WKG0As-/0/1745568640236?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=nMacy0KN_34ZAMVci1habmJOeOKG3ACth2JqYRi3Y4E, https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D22AQHWhblqtbn4lQ/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B4DZZr_5V_G4As-/0/1745568636549?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=ooYThDN_1zrn0nKTuIhiN4TzKEnX2jH_30zzIFvINos, https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D22AQHYKSOylMlzMA/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B4DZZr_5VbGgAo-/0/1745568634581?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=xTQmywTZJUcsgXV9PDwlBFgyYQjdyGRSJbDss_eZA2Q"

A glance at the emblem causes astonishment: a Volkswagen? Yes, exactly!  Built in Brazil starting in 1970, this Volkswagen was developed exclusively for the South American market. With the Type TC 145, the Brazilian engineers created a completely new body variant. It was based on the unchanged floor assembly of the small VW Karmann Ghia and with the 1600cc engine from the VW Type 3, a modern 2+2-seater hatchback coup√© with a large tailgate was created.  üéâ The TC stands for Touring Coup√© and is still great fun 55 years later: the 1.6-litre flat-box engine delivers a husky, sporty sound, and the 40-kW (54 PS) version reaches a top speed of 145 km/h. The TC 145 was manufactured at Karmann-Ghia do Brasil just outside S√£o Paulo until 1975.

In September 1981, we launched the second generation that would remain in production for 13 years.  ‚öñÔ∏è The completely redesigned body increased the length to 3.66 metres and boasted a unique look. The steeply sloping rear made the Polo a two-door estate, small but with plenty of space. The headroom in particular had increased substantially compared with the first model series. Once again, the Polo II was a lightweight car, weighing only 770 kilogrammes in its base version.  üí™ Following the introduction of the squareback, the fastback Coup√© was added to the range in 1982. Under the bonnet were stronger petrol engines, which gave the car faster acceleration.   ‚ûï Already in 1984, the Polo range was supplemented by an entry-level model, the Fox. The limited-edition Polo Coup√© GT G40 was launched in 1987. Offering 85 kW (115 PS), this was the most powerful variant of the Polo so far. It was also the first model to feature the scroll-type supercharger, a new style of compressor developed by Volkswagen.  üöò In 1990, the Polo II received an extensive model update: it now sported eye-catching rectangular headlights, as well as aerodynamically designed, integrated bumpers and a modified radiator grille.

He has long been a fan of the classic #VWPolo: ‚ÄòManoeuvrable and agile, a great shape, the car is fun.‚Äô   üíõ In 2003, he came across a 1977 Polo I L in Riyadh yellow. Built just two years after the start of what is now a 50-year Polo success story. Michael was impressed by its original condition. Unrestored, rarely driven, a garaged car owned by a pensioner. Love at first sight.  üéâ In 2001, Michael met his future wife Heike at a Polo fan meet in Minden, Germany. They started out sharing a hobby, but soon went on to share their lives. When planning their wedding in 2004, there was no decision to be made when it came to the vehicle. ‚ÄòOur fascination with the Polo brought us together,‚Äô says Michael. ‚ÄòSo, of course there was only one wedding car for us: small, yellow and good!‚Äô The small car is known for being compact, so the front passenger seat was quickly removed for the journey into their joint future. The couple-to-be, complete with wedding dress and veil, fit onto the narrow back seat. ‚ÄòThe perfect start for us,‚Äô emphasises Michael.  ‚è© The wedding carriage has since become a family car. Son Tom now sits on the back seat. And there are three more classics living in the Dreisbachs' garage: two Polo and a Golf Cabriolet. The family‚Äôs car for going about daily life is a Golf VII GTI.

For example, the ID.3 GTX* achieves up to 606 kilometers (WLTP), while the ID.7 Pro S** can travel up to 709 kilometers on a single charge.  üèîÔ∏è Real-World Performance And it's not just on paper! A recent range test in Switzerland demonstrated the ID.7's capability, with journalists covering nearly 800 kilometers on public roads on a single charge.  üîã Fast Charging is a Reality Even long highway trips are no problem. YouTuber Christopher Karatsonyi (""Car Maniac"") tested the ID.7 by driving over 400 kilometers at sustained highway speeds of around 150 km/h. He recharged from 5% to 80% in less than 30 minutes‚Äîproving that charging times are faster than ever.  The myth that electric cars are impractical due to limited range and slow charging?

The result: using the ID.4 Pro brings clear potential benefits regarding CO‚ÇÇ emissions compared to a similar car with a combustion engine (ICE).  The logic: The initially higher CO‚ÇÇ emissions in the production phase of this electric car are counteracted during the use phase. This effect can be enforced by consistently charging with green electricity.  üíö If charged only with green power, the ID.4 Pro has a better carbon footprint from around 66,000 km compared to a similar ICE. If charged with the conventional EU power mix, this threshold is around 97,000 km.  üíö Over its full life cycle, the ID.4 Pro saves around 50 percent of CO‚ÇÇ emissions when charged with green electricity (EU mix) ‚Äì in comparison to a similar ICE.  üíö Its CO‚ÇÇ footprint is about 25 percent smaller when charged with the conventional European electricity mix.  ‚ÑπÔ∏è The life cycle analysis was reviewed by T√úV NORD CERT Pr√ºf- und Umweltgutachtergesellschaft mbH.

Do you want to know more about its first generation?   üöò When it was unveiled in March 1975, the Polo was the smallest car we had ever produced. Despite being just 3.5 metres in length, it offered ample space for four people and their luggage. At the time, it became the smallest member of a new, modern model range alongside the Passat, Scirocco, and Golf.   ‚ÑπÔ∏è From a technical perspective, the small car was based on the Audi 50, which had been available since October 1974; the two cars were identical in design, with the exception of a few parts. The high-revving 0.9-litre engine also came from the Audi factory in Ingolstadt. Providing 29 kW (40 PS), it powered the Polo (which weighed just 685 kilogrammes) to speeds of up to 132 km/h.  ü™ô The three-door small car offered a range of equipment that was well-crafted, but had been reduced to the most necessary items to allow the vehicle to be sold at an affordable price. The Polo N was the entry-level version, available from DM 7,500, while the Polo L was available for an additional DM 510. The superior ‚ÄúL‚Äù equipment included a two-stage blower, rear window wiper, and carpet.   ‚û°Ô∏è In 1976, 37 kW and 44 kW (50 PS and 60 PS) engines were added to the range, and a model update provided a more modern look. In 1977, the notchback saloon Derby was launched as an additional body variant. The Polo GT arrived in 1979, offering a sporty look. Customers looking to reduce their fuel consumption could opt for the 1981 Polo Formel E, which included fuel-saving technology.  #Volkswagen #VWPolo #Polo50",1149,1062,68,13,10,27,"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQHBZNmdgPWdJw/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B4EZRPtzjkGYAs-/0/1736504196047?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=CaW7Vwdx0k_yepuD3O_LMVmUz8CwiLHiXT291o_1uQo, https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQGGXgds34I3dw/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B4EZRPtzlfGYAo-/0/1736504201468?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=drnM-r0fapE9wqeICbJqbvUJItnXp6TtrDOAt6hY6D0, https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQEh-L176D1AQg/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B4EZRPtzkiGcAs-/0/1736504202116?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=msO1Bfp_7Jnq6_aj2jXUEa2OnmGW9TRdhkC1C7lQ_mE, https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQHWTqPqwLq6TA/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B4EZRPtzkwHsAo-/0/1736504200666?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=wBOCWYbsjAjHcJe5SBFS0eH58d18xyaGXaywo_xwUD8"

They‚Äôve been running Volkswagen Wedding Co., based in Halifax, England, for over 8 years now, but the love affair with these air-cooled cars started way back when Richard was just a teenager.  üéä¬†The business is both simple and ingenious: Sam and Richard hire out their old VW Campervans and Beetles for weddings, parties and events. When Sam and Richard started out, they had just one car: Victoria, a 1972 campervan from Hanover, Germany. Her interior is completely original and with her ‚ÄòPastel White‚Äô paintwork and chrome trims she makes the perfect wedding vehicle.  üíù¬†The fleet has since been expanded: Rosie, the convertible Beetle, and Herman, the VW photo booth campervan, a 1979 Westfalia Helsinki model. They hope to add more VWs to the fleet in the coming years. ‚ÄúOur family has loved Volkswagens for over 40 years. Our campervans aren't just cars to us, they're full of memories and emotions,‚Äù Sam says. ‚ÄúSo, it only seemed right to share our beautiful VWs with you on your big day.‚Äù  ü´∂¬†Sam is a full-time designer by day, but spends every spare second communicating with customers, organising the bookings and driving Herman the photobooth. Richard is the owner of the sister company VW Restorations. So, when he isn't fixing other people‚Äôs Campers, he's maintaining the fleet, preparing the cars for bookings and he even scrubs up well as a chauffeur.  üõ†Ô∏è¬†Sam‚Äôs first car was a 1978 Last Edition VW Beetle, which Richard taught her how to drive in. She drove the car, which was named Frank, around for years, but sadly it was taken off the road as he needed some TLC. Fast forward 12 years, Sam announced she was getting married and suggested to her dad that she'd like to travel to her wedding in the beloved Beetle.
