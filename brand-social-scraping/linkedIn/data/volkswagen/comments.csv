Room for every adventure! Great to see the ID.4 combining electric performance with everyday practicality — ready for whatever summer has in store. ☀️
"Esperei tanto tempo para ter uma oportunidade de trabalhar na Volkswagen são Carlos, quando abriu eles fizeram pela gupy, fiz a prova online sem colar da internet, Tirei 70 , conheçi umas pessoas que passou com 100, todas sem excessão colaram as respostas da internet, super justos a forma de contratação da Volkswagen são Carlos!!!!"

"Lieber Martin, it was a blast! Danke für die Zeit die du den Händlern und uns bei VW Österreich geschenkt hast! „Durchs Reden kommen d‘Leut zsamm!“ sagt man bei uns, und wir sind uns sicher, bei Dir werden Taten folgen! Österreich und die VW Händler sind bereit 💪 Wir freuen uns auf die elektrische Zukunft, auf die Gegenwart mit Hybrid und Verbrenner und sind stolz auf unser Heritage! Danke für die super Zusammenarbeit mit Dir und Deinem Team!"

Great service i am hungry for this jub
It was a pleasure having you with us – we truly enjoyed the visit! The exchange was inspiring and gave us valuable impulses for the road ahead. ⚡🚗
Strong momentum on the product side despite a challenging regulatory and legal environment. The focus on structural efficiency and forward-looking programs like ‘Future Volkswagen’ will be critical to navigating volatility while staying on track for profitability targets.
"A solid start in a challenging environment — thank you to our customers and teams worldwide. With strong model momentum and a clear focus through the ‘Future Volkswagen’ program, we’re committed to staying on track toward our 2025 goals. 👏 "

"With the profits down more than 30% and Porche's 41 %, this is destined to fail sooner or later big time. I always tell the same story. Once upon a while there must have been many companies selling horse carriages. And 
I bet the last one around made the best horse carriage you ever saw. Now would you like to be a stockholder in that company? Keep getting the increasing market share of a shrinking market, sure but slow, down the tube. They are not dead yet, but are sure to go in the future. It's called obsolescence."
💪💪🦾
"Very stunning design, excited to see this in production."
"Impressive vision, Volkswagen!
While you're reshaping the future of electric city mobility, I propose a simple yet impactful addition:
a built-in waste bin in every vehicle.
It’s time we make our cabins as clean and responsible as the technology driving them.

#CabinClean #SustainableMobility #CleanDesign #SmartInnovation #VW"

Great Challenge…🙌

Tenia que ser el iconico GTI
Impressive work Volkswagen!
"Don´t forget the Polo was a Bertone Design, please confirm who did the Derby conversion...."
Sensacional!🩵👏👏👏👏👏🥇
Legent 😈😍
A true classic with quiet confidence. The VW Derby proved that practicality and style could go hand in hand — and left a lasting mark as one of our most underrated icons. 👏 
Mir gefällt ihm
"It used to be an Audi variant too. Vw should bring back the small coupe or coupe hatchback like Corrado, Sirocco no more 3 doors Golf either. Bring it back ."
Ganz ehrlich....Der Mini Audi 80....
"This was my first car (got it at the age of 18 in 1990) and I loved it!! I had the 50 PS version which was quite ok. 
No it wasn’t as cool as my friends‘ cars! But I was the only one who could easily put 5 beer crates in the boot! 😉
It took me to England (6 months there with a left hand drive) and Italy and it was pure freedom for me! 
Talking about range of BEVs today… my Derby had a 35 litre tank and the range was about 350 km (I was always driving max speed on the motorways which was about 130…140 km/h. It felt faster due to the loud noise of the engine…😀)
When my engine died in 1997, it was the end of my Derby (being 20 years old then) and I was really sad. 
What followed was a Golf III (special edition „family“) which was quite an upgrade, though! 
Thank you Volkswagen for bringing up good memories!"
Hadn't heard of that one!

"😉 ...beautiful car,...It had to be simplicity for drivers....😁 👍 "
"A true icon of understated practicality! The Derby proved that even compact cars could offer remarkable versatility without sacrificing style or comfort. 

The Derby is piece of Volkswagen history that still inspires today’s designs."
That's a neat piece of Volkswagen history. It's interesting how they identified a need for a bit more practicality in the small car segment and cleverly adapted the successful Polo to create the Derby.

"Impressive vision from Volkswagen!
With the expansion of the ID. family, it's clear that sustainability and innovation are driving the future of mobility.
As we imagine cleaner, smarter vehicles, perhaps it's also time to rethink the cabin environment itself.
What if every electric car came with an integrated trash bin to promote clean habits from the inside out?
#CabinClean could be a natural addition to this eco-conscious movement.

Well done!
Arrasou demais! 🎉
Thank you for sharing your insights on Volkswagen's innovative concept cars. I'm curious about your thoughts on how these models might influence consumer preferences in the Chinese market. Could you elaborate on your perspective? I'd love to continue this conversation further.
"Volkswagen Please bring them to Europe!
The pressure will anyway arise from the customer side 😉"
A bold move with over 30 new models on the horizon. This product offensive shows Volkswagen’s commitment to leadership in NEVs.
"If VW wants to live, it must revamp the entire concepts of propulsion systems from ICE to EV.

On top of that positive drive CVT which allows transmission to begin from center of input shaft is not an option. It's a must. For that's the only way to efficiently transmit power from ICE or Electric Motors to the wheels.

Do not engage price war with the Chinese. You can't win them in selling cheap products. They are the champions in making things ridiculously cheap. But you can easily beat them in technological breakthrough. They don't have one. They don't even know how to improve their products. Maybe reliabilities aren't important to them. Hit and run is."

"A great step, keep pushing - market results will follow!"
"Hey look, someone other than the US is getting cool models.. "
"Bold vision, clear roadmap! 🚀"
"Three concept cars, three bold visions, one clear message: the future of mobility is smart, electric, and deeply attuned to local markets. Volkswagen’s commitment to China’s EV landscape is both strategic and inspiring, even more so considering what great opportunities growing markets in China can provide!"
"We all like this! Now, please bring the TCR back!"
Absolutely amazing
"Volkswagen 

Life is a journey, like a room full of people who say, ""Yes, let's stay in it,"" and others who aspire to think outside the box."

"Congrats to the Volkswagen team on launching the ID. EVO – a strong step for the brand and the future of mobility.
Great to see it hit the road soon!"
"I think the path of the two face strategy, one pair of lights at hood level and one below, shows the incompetence and distraction, we have in automotive design today, some feature also three faces...it´s a decade of barock, but lacking barocks overall conception... sorry, i´m in the business now 45 years."

"This is where i feel VW has started loosing it’s identity… 

as this design does not seems to resemble an iconic VW design layout… 

which i used to be in love with.."
"A bold step into the future! The ID. EVO showcases how deeply we're listening to our customers in China — smart, digital, and designed with purpose."

Reef Blue steht dem Polo gut.👍 💪
Gerade in dieser Farbe geleast 😀 
"Nice colour!
Time to end the depressing era of white, black and grey cars!"
"This is perfect, I like this color and of course this Volkswagen! 🙂"
Valeu por compartilhar!
"best looking little cutie, definitely blue"
It's beautiful. I like it very much.
That is a great blue.
Dommage que la polo ne soit pas disponible au Canada

Is this the R-Line Off-road Version?
I prefer a complete different design
Send the Pollo to the US…

"What a beautiful colour.... Another beautiful vintage colours would be ""Harlekin"" and ""Tornado Red"" 👌 "
When will it come to india
Beautiful car. Will it be available in the USA?
Llegara a uruguay?
Not a colour out of the box...
Polo ♥️
Ik ben het er 💯 mee eens
Reef Blue really brings out the sporty side of the Polo R-Line. Looks stunning!
"Love it 💯, when is this going to launch in india
People are still waiting. 

 #Polo #PoloGTI  #GermanEngineering #AutoPerformance"
This color + GTI 🥳🥳🥳👍
The 'Reef Blue Metallic' is stunning! I wonder how it compares to the 'Deep Black Pearl' in terms of resale value.
Atleast some designs tell they were done by VW designers…
Nice car 👍👍😎
"Lembrou muito o saudoso ""Golzinho quadrado"". Que belezura! 🥰 Jônatas de Oliveira Esposito Esposito"
"Very much evolutionary follow-up to the e-up. Same design language - which has been most successful for VW. 

however… I don’t think it’ll be any good, and in fact, pretty much useless as a dune mobile. Appreciate the Baja 1000 spirit - but it’s not a new Baja Beetle or buggy!!!"
Perfect fit for Mqb27 👌🏿
Absolutely amazing
Boooorrringggg.

Congratulazioni! 🎉
Meisterwerk! Only VW logo on rear bumper should be white light too!
"Playful, progressive, and full of character – that’s the spirit of ID. 👏 "

Very nice design! Should be available now already!
Following up 
"Volkswagen is doing something special with the ID:Every1 concept. We can see the dedication, the innovation, and most importantly — the heart behind it all.

To Mr. Andreas Mindt and his incredible team: thank you for your vision, creativity, and hard work. You’re not just designing cars — you're designing dreams for everyday people. And to the CEO of VW, on behalf of all of us, thank you for steering this journey with purpose.

We know these things take time. But we’re patient. Because what you’re building is worth the wait.

From the entire community — thank you for everything you do.

Respectfully,

"A design language that speaks for the Volkswagen brand, but unfortunately not a 2-door variant"
"Interesting concept car...great design language...is what an electric city car should be; but I don't understand/agree with its positioning as a ""dune buggy"". Not a chance in hell that this will be sold in the USA :¬)"
Bonito o Golf elétrico! Para chegar até a praia ficou bacana... Agora para chegar até a Vila de Jeri faltam algumas características de off-road nesse conceito aí... daí conseguir vencer o passeio nas dunas!! Vide exemplo do Mini no Dakar 😉 ⚡ 🚗

"As a vw finatic this resonates with me. I have had 30+ different vws over the last 20 years. VW is a brand the breeds a unique passion. My Mk1s are tiny compared to modern cars but at 6’1” i still felt that I had plenty of room.  As an enthusiast I can’t go without saying, please don’t forget what gave this brand its customer base was creating cars that were fun and engaging.  The enthusiast community was devistated that vw decided to drop the manual transmission.  I can say, impartially, that no other car community is as passionate as the vw community. I don’t know of any other car brand where you could mention a car model and any person in your family probably has a story about an adventure in said model.  Please keep making cars that are tactile, engaging and fun."

Timeless elegance and sporty charm! The VW Scirocco II ‘White Cat’ is still turning heads 40 years later. A true classic with a style that never fades.
Can’t beat the People’s Car and 80’s design
Pure '80s elegance! The Scirocco White Cat still turns heads with its alpine-white style and sporty charm. A true icon for collectors and retro car lovers alike.
😊 👍 
"Thank you for sharing this exciting update about the ID. EVERY1 concept car! It's inspiring to see Volkswagen's commitment to innovation and sustainability reflected in this compact and electric design. The emphasis on adventure and the future is truly captivating. Looking forward to seeing how this concept evolves and contributes to the automotive industry. 
"
Absolutely stunning! The future looks bright (and fast!) with the ID. EVERY1. 😍⚡
"How is this thing more innovative than the e-Up, with 10 years in between both models? Same price, slightly bigger, same power, same range. 2027 will be late, this thing should have been there in 2023 when the e-Up was discontinued. You can do better, VW…"

"GOOD MORNING, WOB…a Concept Car of an AFFORDABLE BEV? REALLY? 
10 years TOO LATE, VW has given up Market Leadership in China whilst oversleeping to give answers to „TOYOTA‘s Hybrid Strategy“ AND „China‘s OEMs Electrification Strategy“ FOR YEARS! 

In 2025 VW „CELEBRATES“ the „CONCEPT CAR“ in a Market Segment that is the MOST Price-competitive in the industry, has a low growth rate struggeling to reach 25% market share and in which even Chinese manufacturers GAVE UP. 

AND? 
TOYOTA is developing further cars like the „MIRAI“, KAWASAKI just showed the integration of HYDROGEN in „Walking Robots“ and KiaHyundai announces a new HYDROGEN Strategy. 

In the light of the „LIMITED Availability of „RARE METALS“ and the missing loading infrastructure in many countries, it seems to be probable, that BEVs are only a transition technology on the way to „GREEN HYDROGEN“…

HOPEFULLY the low margins in the A-segment BEV are sufficient to start the „Race against Time“ for „Green Hydrogen“…or else VW might AGAIN be a FOLLOWER rather than INNOVATOR…Tic Tac"

"That’s such a fun feature, especially for nostalgic gamers—kudos to Volkswagen for bringing a classic like PAC-MAN right into the car! In addition to dedicated apps like AirConsole, I’ve also seen some interesting browser-based and web streaming solutions for infotainment systems. It opens up even more possibilities for quick entertainment (think puzzle games, web-based video streaming, etc.) without having to download anything extra. It will be exciting to see how automakers keep innovating and integrating all these experiences seamlessly into the in-car environment!"
"Pac-Man is fun to play — but driving like Pac-Man? 
Not so much.

I received my brand new VW Passat 2025 in early March. Since then, it’s spent more time in the workshop than on the road. It's now been 4 weeks in the garage due to a persistent software issue.

In the age of software-defined vehicles, it would be great if the software actually worked. Maybe it’s time to fix the bugs before rolling out the next big digital feature?

Looking forward to the day my Passat not only looks great — but also drives.

Happy 75th to Volkswagen Ireland and to the legendary Beetle! 🏁👏"
I’ll have to go and see this piece of Irish motoring history. On my German exchange trip some years ago I previously saw the 1 millionth and 20 millionth Beetles at Stiftung AutoMuseum Volkswagen in Wolfsburg.

Dear Sir:

Our objective is to seek support for a person with a disability.


Taking this into account, we seek the support of local companies to help us with a car to be able to mobilize, to be able to take the bicycle to competitions in other cities. And not only that, also being able to help my mother with the loads we work selling used clothes and among others. Besides, I don't have work or money, it's the only thing I survive by helping my mother.

Of course, we will aim to highlight your company, show your name and logo on our different media and communication channels related to this event: t-shirts, jerseys, publications on social networks such as Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok and YouTube.

We remain at your disposal to present our project in more detail during a possible meeting, if you consider it appropriate.

It would be a pleasure to meet and continue talking.
In the meantime, I send you my best regards.

"I had a Polo GT from 1992, what great memories. Burned quiet a big amount of runner with it. Not so safe tough, that missing front subframe was quite missed there."
これは素晴らしい
Este grozav
One of my favorite Cars.
"It may sound trivial, while Volkswagen is literally a people's car but I love when car manufacturers produce affordable cars such as Polo, because it sticks to a concept of a car being not a luxury, but a means of transportation. Lots of respect of Volkswagen for Polo and recently presented EVERY1. Since I am still that stinky lover of petrol cars,  I hope I'll be happy to see a new generation of Polo's some day"
Was a great car.
I remember I painted my friend's Polo in a black and white Puma sports shoe design back in 91/92. This was one of my first bigger projects as a young vehicle refinisher.
"1st car: Polo I in Mandarin Orange
2nd car: Polo II in non series blue
3rd car: Polo II in white

Lost the 1st (almost as old as myself) in a deer accident, the 2nd in a car crash, sold the 3rd for a Golf II...

Reliable little cars despite their age and mileage. Transport a washing machine? No probs, just throw it in."
"Mein erster für 600 Mark, die Kiste war damals älter als ich selbst - noch mit Chokehebel. Jeder Start im Winter war ein Lotteriespiel. An einem Morgen starb dann der Motor und ich musste den Wagen über das Messegelände in Hannover zu einem Parkplatz schieben - habe seit dem keinen eigenen VW mehr besessen... der darauf folgende Nissan Sunny war bedeutend zuverlässiger 🤷‍♂️"
My last VW Polo II G40 😢 sold in 2008 or 2009.
Das erste Auto vergisst man nie. VW Polo GT 55 PS. 😃👍
Well executed
"… da gab es noch deutsche Artikel, oder??"
Love it ❤️
"I've got a 1988 1.3 coupe sport, that I show, completely original with only 45000 miles on it from new, I absolutely love it completely analogue driving experience, so much more fun than modern cars"
Don’t forget the Polo Classic
VW would make a killing if they brought the new polo over to Canada... Not everyone wants a honking SUV. Just Make it N/A and a normal automatic... 
"I completely agree. But we'd be better off if all of their models were sold in Mexico. Mexico is an emerging economy, and people's purchasing power is increasing."
Great news
"Average selling price of a vehicle 28.392 euro, average profit per vehicle 832 euro."

Wo gibt’s den? Kann man den mal Probe sitzen? 
Impressive 😍  
Concept?  Who cares.
"Volkswagen’s ID. EVERY1 at €20k is a bold step toward democratizing EVs in Europe. Beyond the sleek design and modular MEB platform, the focus on lifelong software updates could redefine ownership—imagine a car that evolves with your needs, not just depreciates.  

Key questions for the road ahead:  
🔋 Battery Economics: Can VW’s scale + vertical integration (e.g., gigafactories) keep costs competitive amid volatile raw material prices?  
🔄 Circularity: Will affordability pair with sustainable EOL strategies (battery recycling, material reuse) to meet EU’s CSRD demands?  
🏎️ FWD Trade-offs: Front-wheel drive boosts efficiency, but how will it balance with performance expectations in sportier segments?  

Excited to see how the “9 models by 2027” plan accelerates Europe’s EV adoption race."

Wow!!!
"At this difficult time for VW it is the perfect stalling tactic car:
A. It fulfills all the _ _ _ requirements;
- it restricts people’s movement 
- it can track any movement at any time anywhere 
- it can be switched off in case of a…let’s say incorrect way of thinking of the owner
- when the battery goes kaputt in 5-7 years “you will own nothing and you will be happy”
- It is not all bad however; nobody will steal this engineering masterpiece and after the third year when the car would have lost about 85% of its value, the owner would become indifferent to it, kind of numb and accepting reality.
B. VW already has the car so no further major investment will be required in the next two (uncertain) years apart from couple of different body panels and some eye catching light effects 
Just perfect!"
見事な仕事です
"VW is chasing shrinking ICE market, slow but sure, down the tube. How will it price wise compare to Chinese offerings in 2027? Now when you can get Xiamoi SU7 for 27.000 US $ down there, and this will cost in Europe 20.000 €. I see no point of getting the latest of VW offering, just to expensive for what they are offering. "
Impressive lineup! I'm curious though: do you have any plans to bring Apple Car Key to the ID family? - or to any VW vehicle for what matters
…. And then with  hydrogen engines too !! 🙌🏻
Beautiful car !! And more VW cars with combustion engine too !🙌🏻

"Congratulations  @Volkswagen, always presenting ideal products and solutions for the market. One recommendation is to make the electric portfolio available to the Brazilian market as a sales option. Brazil has been growing every year with electromobility and the satisfaction of Brazilians is to have their own car, even better if it is electric and VW."

Das design gefällt mir 
Wieder nur für Engländer???? Warum??
Big potential🍀
Fascinating!
"Like the concept, bold clean not too stylish, but! Too late! Available from 2027 on? Come on VDUB!
I think times have changed an no one nowadays will wait nearly two years…unless its an iconic or a limited number supercar…and also technical standards can change during that time…it‘s likely it will be outdated when it hits the showrooms…
But please, proof me wrong! :)"
Looks great
Stunning

This is great
I wish it comes sooner... 
Beautiful car! A real Volkswagen ❤️
"Wow, the ID. EVERY1 sounds like the perfect car for when you need to pick up your friends and their 305 litres of luggage! Can't wait to see it on the roads in 2027. Maybe by then it will come with a built-in coffee maker for those long drives 😉"
This is great!
If Apple was so slow as German Automakers
"Wenn mir der Wagen gefällt dann muss ich zwei Jahre warten. In dieser Zeit haben sich die Kunden für die Konkurrenz entschieden. Ich verstehe das VW Marketing nicht mehr. Volkswagen sollte sich mal überlegen was ihre Zielgruppe ist und wen man in der Zukunft erreichen möchte. Warum heißen die Modelle nicht mehr Polo, Golf oder Passat. Die Kunden sind viel traditioneller als das Marketing glaubt. Bitte beerdigt die ID Reihe!"
Mein nächstes Auto!
"If you sell it in Turkey, there will be a lot of demand. If the price is reasonable, I will buy it too."
How can I test it?
Design ist ja wohl nicht der größte Wurf. Kein Mut mehr ?? Wann kommt denn mal wieder ein richtiger Headturner???
"VW electric cars will inspiring us like 
We always Felt in love with VW motors ❤"
"PowerPoint Präsentationen von Absichtserklärungen!

"I’m sad, because we has two VW and an another VW concern (Porsche) in aou family, but the company now have lot of delay in the E-car era. This car will release in 2027. Under two year perhaps the E-car concept will go to the background, or grow another way, and the VW will be stay in another delay in the automotive."

C’est génial
"It's helpful to know the Tayron's carrying capabilities. The towing capacity of up to 2,500 kg, depending on the setup, sounds quite robust."

"I'm a Volkswagen fan, and I've been following the evolution of cars year after year, and the evolution of Volkswagen's interior and finishing is impressive, they're the most beautiful on the market!
"
Looks great
Looking really good 🤗
"Why the VW ID. EVERY1 Must Stand Out. 

My recommendation would be:

- Best-in-class efficiency – <11 kWh/100 km, beating all competitors.
- Ultra-fast charging – 10-80% in ~20 minutes, faster than Dacia Spring & Fiat Panda Electric.
- Affordable price – ~€20,000, but with better value than competitors.
- mid-level safety package – Emergency braking, lane assist, blind-spot monitoring as standard.
- LFP battery technology – Long lifespan (500,000+ km), lower cost, fast-charging durability.
- Smart interior – Sliding doors, fold-flat front seats, modular storage for urban flexibility.
- Compact but spacious – Polo-sized with maximum space efficiency.
- Hybrid UI – Physical buttons + smart voice control, no touchscreen frustration.
- City-optimized design – Built for real-world urban mobility, not just range specs."

Cant wait to see this! Date marked ✔️
Not bad for a brand that realised ICE is a better way forward

"Affordable EVs are a game-changer, making sustainable mobility accessible to more people. By launching a cost-effective electric vehicle, Volkswagen is not only accelerating EV adoption but also strengthening its position in the market. A wider customer base means greater brand loyalty and long-term growth. Looking forward to seeing this launch on March 5th! ⚡🚗"
"Love it , looks like retro rabbit"

"This is fantastic news! An electric car for 20,000 euros is a real step towards making EVs more accessible for everyone. I’m looking forward to March 5th to see what the new ID. will be like. It seems to promise a perfect blend of style, quality, and innovation in a compact form. Can’t wait to learn all the details!

Das ist ein großer Schritt in die Zukunft der Elektromobilität! ⚡🚗💚 Ich bin gespannt auf den 5. März – Innovation zum Greifen nah!

"At last you realize where your price point should be. You need a Buzz you can sell for 49,000 MSRP.  Ut your extremely high destination charge. You know that is just the OEM equivalent of an ADM sticker."
Its great to see electric vehicle start to hit the more affordable markets and this will be the start of the journey.

That sounds like an incredible adventure. A 1500km journey from Copenhagen to Swedish Lapland in electric vehicles is quite the undertaking. 
"That sounds like an absolutely incredible adventure! Driving through stunning Scandinavian landscapes, experiencing the beauty of electric mobility, and sharing the journey with fellow ID. enthusiasts—what could be better?

I would love to be part of such an experience in the future! Could you share more details on how to participate in the next Volkswagen Driving Experience event?

Dear Sir:

Our objective is to seek support for a person with a disability.


Taking this into account, we seek the support of local companies to help us with a car to be able to mobilize, to be able to take the bicycle to competitions in other cities. And not only that, also being able to help my mother with the loads we work selling used clothes and among others. Besides, I don't have work or money, it's the only thing I survive by helping my mother.

Of course, we will aim to highlight your company, show your name and logo on our different media and communication channels related to this event: t-shirts, jerseys, publications on social networks such as Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok and YouTube.

We remain at your disposal to present our project in more detail during a possible meeting, if you consider it appropriate.

It would be a pleasure to meet and continue talking.
In the meantime, I send you my best regards.

That's a fascinating advancement in all-wheel drive technology. It sounds like it really enhances the car's handling.

"Too bad that the Golf R will never be approved as a company car due to its hilariously high fuel consumption / CO2.

But having four-wheel drive in the current GTE would be a totally different case!"

"MOLD . . . BUYER BE AWARE! I have the same issue with my Tiguan leaking continuously . The dealership, VW of Oakland says the problem is fixed . . . the car has BLACK MOLD! VW America is aware of the matter and continues to sell defective cars! So not good, there is a asthmatic child at risk in this situation! So terrible that VW puts profit of people, a child no less! #DIRTYDEALSVW"
Atemberaubende Farbkombination
"What an innovative and exciting transformation! The ID. Buzz in rally dress not only pays homage to the legendary Porsche 911 Dakar but also showcases the versatility and creative potential of electric vehicles. This unique blend of heritage and modernity could inspire other automakers to explore similar crossovers, merging classic rally aesthetics with contemporary electric technology. Kudos to Mark Wegh for this imaginative idea! Looking forward to seeing more such creative endeavors in the automotive world. 🚗⚡️"
Great brands consistently deliver impressive designs. I particularly like the Dakar version of the VW—it looks fantastic! I would love to see more off-road variants in the future.

Hope it will be roun about the 20K€
Very intriguing design. Good evolution of the VW design language. 
Looks great! 
"I like the concept in that, as the CEO of Rivian mentions, smaller cars with less range are the future. There is no need for a giant battery. Its just gluttony.  My e-golf has maybe 120 miles of range and its great for 97% of my needs at 4.4 miles per kwh.  Many of these giant electric cars are getting half that and that is approaching gasoline prices so why bother?"

"The Netherlands and Norway have set the standard for EV charging infrastructure, but the key to replicating their success across Europe is a mix of strong incentives, government-backed strategy, and smart deployment. Norway’s approach worked because of financial incentives and long-term planning, while the Netherlands built a dense and accessible charging network to remove barriers for drivers. For other European markets to catch up, the focus needs to be on coordinated policy, investment in urban and rural coverage, and ensuring grid capacity can handle the transition. We’re seeing progress, but targeted action is needed to close the infrastructure gap."

"In what tempature is this measured? If we take me as an example, I live where it can be very cold and I know that Volkswagen have it's own research in there own places far north, what was the result there? Like to know before I buy one. Nice results from Mercedes 😉."
When will Volkswagen deliver pre-heating for ID models with Software version 3.7 (previous 4.0)? At least manual pre-heating would be the minimum to increase DC charge speed in cold conditions.

"Bought this car in May 2024. The dealership underperformed and did not come through on their promises. It doesn’t matter now, they have my money. 

A little thought for your well qualified “designers” and “engineers”, please try to adjust your climate control on a touch screen while driving. No back lighting on the touch control on volume and temperature control makes quick adjustments even more annoying. 

The constant beeping from sensors failing screams anxiety, and the beep that could alarm me of a catastrophic engine failure is the same as something minor like low washer fluid. 

On a positive note the vehicle performs well, and it does a wonderful job in the snow."

the lamps dazzle my eyes🤩
"Und ist der Golf 8 Facelift immer noch schlecht verarbeitet, wie meiner (vorfacelift)?"
Das Design und die Farbe sind wirklich attraktiv.
Idée fantastique
Golf best car ever! I bought my first on 1980!

"Brought this exact car from a Citygate branch.

We have been treated terribly by VW, UK and the Dealers.

We told the car dealers the GardX was not applied properly and they said they would re apply but this was after we called GardX.  A week after we brought the car they reapplied which normally takes around 12 hours they called me back in 3 saying it’s ready. They had cleaned the interior even though it was being applied to the exterior and I didn’t instruct or give them permission to clean the interior of my car and they  scratched all around the central console so we complained to VW UK.

VW UK sat on our complaint for over a month we have time stamped pictures which shows at the time the car was only a week old but between VW UK and  the dealership they are saying because they received  the complaint a month later they won’t do anything.

We keep informing VW that it’s down to them as we complained to VW UK 2 days after  the damage as the damage was on a Friday so you have to add the weekend and I even called the dealership when i collected the car that day when we discovered the scratches. This issue has not yet been resolved, we brought the car in late September 2024."
😍😍😍
"Nice, but interior quality still lack some of that Mk7 magic."
If only it can be had in a manual. and a replaceable lightbulb. Not $1500 for a whole headlight housing just because the DRL “burnt out”
Esto es genial
Harika
Impressive

Awesome product
That is very good analysis. However the lifetime of a modern car is considered to be around 200 000km. That is why it is important to drive your car for at least 10 years and 200 000 km before replacing your car.

How about this comparison including impact of battery dismantling?
Such an obsolete EV compared to Chinese. And the price is a rip off.

"Das sind beeindruckende Zahlen! 🚗💚 Es ist spannend zu sehen, wie sich die CO₂-Bilanz über den gesamten Lebenszyklus hinweg entwickelt und wie wichtig die Rolle von Ökostrom dabei ist. Gerade die Kombination aus technologischem Fortschritt und bewusster Energieauswahl zeigt, dass nachhaltige Mobilität machbar ist – und zwar mit echten Vorteilen für die Umwelt.
Ein inspirierender Prompt könnte sein: 'Welche zusätzlichen Innovationen könnten den CO₂-Fußabdruck von E-Fahrzeugen in der Produktionsphase noch weiter senken? Und wie könnte KI dabei helfen, diese Prozesse zu optimieren?'
Freue mich auf den weiteren Austausch zu diesem spannenden Thema! 🚀"
This is great 🌲🌴🌳
"It’s fascinating to see how the ID.4 Pro performs in a full life cycle assessment, especially with the impact of green electricity."

. Better than Toyota Prius in shape."
Great 💐💐
The transition to Electrified Transportation has to include renewables. Kudos to VW and the whole team for thinking about Climate Change in a holistic way. 
"A great step toward sustainable mobility, supporting renewables and decarbonization beyond electrification!"
"""941 km on a single charge? But simulating urban speed of 20 km/h? Small 'negligible' details.""😅🤭"
"With average speed 29 km/h? Dubious achievement, hmm."
Looks great!
excellent achievement 👏 
"Impressive result!

Es sollte aber auch erwähnt werden dass die Durchschnittsgeschwindigkeit 29km/h war. Ansonsten werden falsche Erwartungen getriggert.
So auch beim mir beim Lesen der Headline."
Das freue mich zu hören. Entwicklung geht weiter!!
