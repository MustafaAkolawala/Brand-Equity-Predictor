We thank FICCI and Hon’ble Minister Ministry of Road Transport and Highways Shri Nitin Gadkari for awarding us the prestigious FICCI Road Safety Awards 2024 for our breakthrough initiatives towards enhancing Road Safety. Maruti Suzuki won dual accolades at the awards towards  •	First-Aid Trauma Care Training for Drivers under the Healthcare Initiatives for Road Safety category. Under the initiative, 8,500 people, primarily commercial drivers have been trained to become First Responders during the ‘golden hour’ after accidents.  •	Automated Driving Test Tracks (ADTT) under the Initiatives/Interventions by Automobile Companies category. ADTTs have enabled automation of driving license testing using video analytics technology and zero human intervention. This ensures only skilled drivers get behind the wheel, making roads safer for all. Maruti Suzuki in partnership with Delhi govt has introduced 100% automation in driving license testing in the state.   Maruti Suzuki has been working extensively over the past two decades on Road Safety.
