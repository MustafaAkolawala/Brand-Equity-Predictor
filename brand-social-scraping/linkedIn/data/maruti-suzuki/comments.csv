"I purchased Maruti Fronx on 30th January 2024 and after driving only for 10 km its front left tyre burst and that too I got 3rd free service done on the same day. The tyre burst on a normal road, the car was controlled with very difficulty, otherwise life could have been lost I complained about it to the service centre but there was no help from anywhere I think Maruti Suzuki India Limited tyre build quality is very poor

"Dear Sir/Madam,
I, Sanyam Sharma, the owner of Maruti Suzuki Wagon R, Registration No. HR16AB4843, writing you against your authorized service centre, Sri Parkash Automobiles, Bajghera Road, New Palam Vihar, Gurgaon-122001, for engaging in fraudulent practices, breach of trust, and clear deficiency in services & No one is bothered to reply on the emails i have sent to contact team. In September 2024, my vehicle met with an accident, and I approached your authorized centre, Sri Parkash Automobiles, for necessary repairs under my Zero Depreciation Insurance Policy (Insurer: Bajaj Allianz, Claim No. OC-25-11-2-1825-00001168, dated 23-09-2024). the car was repaired, and I was told that all parts claimed under insurance were duly replaced:
Mr. Kapil (Manager – Accidental Repairs) – +91-9289109906
Mr. Harish (Manager – Service Centre) – +91-9971110716,+91-9711777217,+91-9999389458
An insurance claim was made and received for a new RHS Wheel Rim, an old Stepney (spare wheel) was provided instead, which is a clear act of misrepresentation. I was assured that the correct part would be provided within one week, I hope someone will look into it.

"Dear Mr. Takeuchi, After months of ignored emails (with complaint IDs) sent to h.takeuchi@maruti.co.in and your senior leadership, I'm taking this public.
My brand new Maruti Jimny [MH43CM1309], purchased August 2024 from Excell Autovista (Chembur, Mumbai), has been stuck at Maruti Sai Service, Turbe, Navi Mumbai for three agonizing months.
The issue? A dangerous leftward tilt after just ~15km of driving, compromising safety and drivability.
I've repeatedly requested a comprehensive report detailing precise measurements of alignment, suspension, and related components. Instead, I've received nothing but silence.
This isn't just poor service; it's a blatant disregard for customer safety and satisfaction.
Mr. Takeuchi, I demand your immediate, personal intervention. I need a concrete plan to resolve this NOW. My patience has run out."

"Hello, my name is Freddy, I'm from Chile. I bought a Suzuki Alto, year 2025. To date, it has 2,000 kilometers and it started with a sudden noise in the engine. I have a video that shows the noise. Where can I write so you can tell me what the car could have? It's too new to be having faults. Can you help me?"
"U people need to Hire some senseable regional incharge in the plant wherein they can visit dealers all over India. Making people work overtime don't pay them, harrase them too, this is how u train them?  Work time 9.30am to 6.30pm making them wait till 8 to 9pm late sm dealers have no proper Street lights it anything happens to a woman who will be responsible? Dealers hv no sense of marketing making sales people to share pamplets to every shops n put it in every bikes seriously 😂😂 atleast hv some basic standards. Hv some sense make some events at the malls etc owners can't even invest ??? Just suck dry out the blood from workers pay less make them work more, no Proper AC vents in the showroom Maruti Suzuki India Limited"
But you are selling customer data to health insurance companies for cheap price. Health insurance companies telecallers deliberately called me and I’m a owner of Maruti Suzuki made car and that have a plan for my health insurance . Shame on you for selling my details to cheap telecallers.
A proud milestone for #MakeInIndia! 🇮🇳🚙 Kudos to #MarutiSuzuki for driving innovation and expanding India’s footprint in the global market! 🌍👏

"I am writing to express my disappointment and frustration with the misleading advertisement on your official portal. It is showing a silver grey colour and after delivery, I am getting white colour.
Last Sunday, I wasted my three hours and fuel by visiting your Nexa Service station (Ghodbunder) showroom to pick the below product as described on your official website. 
Finally after three hours, I was shown the body cover in the white colour which I never requested.
As per your website, the product is in silver grey colour as shown in the order. 
The advertisement claimed a false or misleading claim, which is not true. I purchased the product/service based on this claim and was disappointed to find that it did not deliver as promised.
I request that you take immediate action to correct this misleading advertisement and provide a refund for my purchase along with compensation. 
After escalation at your nexa showroom, I placed the order on your official portal and applied the payment.
Finally, I received the wrong products (White colour) which I never requested. I placed the ordered only by looking at the pics on your portal.
This is misleading. None of your management is sure about such products and online portal."
Thanks for sharing
"I had made payment of Rs 5000 at Kuldeep Motors Lucknow vide receipt number 2423 dated 2nd December 2024 for booking of a new vehicle.

The booking was done for the below variant :

Variant name : Maruti Alto K10 VXI+ (O) AGS (ATA4IV2)
Color : Silver

I was given confirmation from the dealership that the vehicle would be delivered to me in December 2024 month itself. The confirmation was given during my visit at the dealership and on whatsapp as well. In the last week of December 2024 I was informed that now the vehicle cannot be delivered and the vehicle would be made available in the month of January 2025. 

Now during my visit to the dealership I was not given any satisfactory answer from your dealership staff.

I have not been given any physical document for the booking from the dealership except the receipt image on the whatsapp. No physical document like recept, booking confirmation or quotation was provided to me.

Kindly help and arrange to provide status for my booking and when the company would be able to provide me the desired variant of color of my choice.

"Dear; Maruti Suzuki India Limited 

I'm Ritupal, a former apprentice at Maruti Suzuki India Limited (MSIL), Gurugram. During my tenure from June 8, 2023, to June 30, 2024, I gained valuable technical skills and work discipline. I received a message on July 16, 2024, stating I was eligible for the internal conversion test on July 22, 2024. However, due to nervousness, I accidentally presented my old PAN card with an incorrect date of birth. Despite having the updated PAN card, I was denied entry to the test. I contacted the MSIL helpline and was told I could try again next month. Unfortunately, despite multiple follow-ups, I never received a reply. I applied again through Vision India, but the status remains pending. I take full responsibility for my mistake and request a second chance. I'm ready to provide all required documents again and appear for verification if needed.

Yours faithfully,

Great Maruti Suzuki India Limited. Commendable. Internship remains the soul source of practical learning in the journey from 'Campus to Corporate' but unfortunately this avenue remains largely untapped or not taken with due seriousness by both sides. Industry flag bearer like Maruti Suzuki show-casing such initiatives on LinkedIn platform adds great weight and importance to the same. I wish let many other houses also to step in similar fashion and make it a win-win proposition for both. 👍

"Worst  experience with Nexa  , Maruti Suzuki India Limited , from 6 jan 2025 when i bought my baleno delta ,  refused over kia sonet, only because good service, but i think its my wrong decision.  In one month, i gone 9  time in the Nexa workshop,  but cabin noise , window  noise  issue not resolved. Use packing in new car to resolved in ,  this is Maruti Suzuki India Limited  quality. 

Really such a bad discussion to buy Maruti Suzuki India Limited  ,s  car ."
Finally Maruti Suzuki India Limited paid tribute to Osama Suzuki San by achieving this Mile Stone and it’s a significant milestone to mention in Make In India Segment!

Hello sir Maruti Suzuki India limited my dream hai sir please sir
"Excell Autovista Baner should change its tagline to ‘Wash and Wait’! Dropped my Brezza for its second free service at 10:30 AM, was told there were 23 cars ahead. Fair enough, I left to get some work done, only to return at 5 PM and find out they had done absolutely NOTHING except a car wash. To top it off, I had to update the stereo myself using my own memory drive because the entire showroom doesn’t even have backup software! Is this a service center or a DIY workshop? Absolutely pathetic and feels like a complete scam. Maruti Suzuki India Limited  should look into it."
But failed in terms of Customer Services......
"Want to purchase the brezza 
Lxi in black color but dealer denying that black color is not available in LXI"
"Congratulations!
Keep growing"

"Maruti suzuki being  the first Indian car company to manufacture 2 million passenger vehicles, it has played a pioneering role in making car ownership accessible to millions in India. Balancing affordability, fuel efficiency, and a vast service network has been its strength. Constructive criticism is always welcome, but let’s also appreciate the milestones that have shaped the Indian automotive industry."""
Maruti ( Machis ka dabba) should be ban in India !!
Great news
Incredible achievement!! Congratulations
Toyota Aquire maruti wait some time. maruti already a japanse company not indian now. all money send to out of country 
Congrats!
What about the quality of product ?? What if 10- 15 Lakh rupees product is not safe. Post sales operations are only to extract money from customer. Quality of Sample Car Vs Actual on sales ground. 
No....... only manufacturing in this sector is not sufficient ....after sales is the most important which this company is heavily lacking .....no coordination with manufacturing and administration ????????
"Despite relentless follow-ups, multiple complaints, and even involving you Maruti Suzuki India Limited, there has been absolutely NO resolution to my ongoing car battery issue with Exide Industries Limited
 My Maruti car still has to be jump-started every single week, rendering it as unreliable as a used car with a decade-old battery.
Fortpoint Automotive Cars Pvt Ltd, has taken my car multiple times for battery and electrical validation, only to return it with no resolution and vague explanations. I am caught in a frustrating loop between the battery manufacturer and the car brand Maruti Suzuki India Limited, with neither owning up or providing a lasting solution.
How is it acceptable that a 4-month-old battery becomes a liability?
This is more than just a faulty battery now. It’s about the mental fatigue, the disruption to daily life, the countless wasted hours, and the sheer apathy from companies who claim to care.
I am writing this not just for myself anymore, but for every customer who’s been ignored, misled, and left stranded.
I hope this post reaches someone with the integrity and authority to do the right thing before this becomes a case study in poor service."

"Dear Mr. Takeuchi, After months of ignored emails (with complaint IDs) sent to h.takeuchi@maruti.co.in and your senior leadership, I'm taking this public.
My brand new Maruti Jimny [MH43CM1309], purchased August 2024 from Excell Autovista (Chembur, Mumbai), has been stuck at Maruti Sai Service, Turbe, Navi Mumbai for three agonizing months.
The issue? A dangerous leftward tilt after just ~15km of driving, compromising safety and drivability.
I've repeatedly requested a comprehensive report detailing precise measurements of alignment, suspension, and related components. Instead, I've received nothing but silence.
This isn't just poor service; it's a blatant disregard for customer safety and satisfaction.
Mr. Takeuchi, I demand your immediate, personal intervention. I need a concrete plan to resolve this NOW. My patience has run out."

"I am writing to express my disappointment and frustration with the misleading advertisement on your official portal. It is showing a silver grey colour and after delivery, I am getting white colour.
Last Sunday, I wasted my three hours and fuel by visiting your Nexa Service station (Ghodbunder) showroom to pick the below product as described on your official website. 
Finally after three hours, I was shown the body cover in the white colour which I never requested.
As per your website, the product is in silver grey colour as shown in the order. 
The advertisement claimed a false or misleading claim, which is not true. I purchased the product/service based on this claim and was disappointed to find that it did not deliver as promised.
I request that you take immediate action to correct this misleading advertisement and provide a refund for my purchase along with compensation. 
After escalation at your nexa showroom, I placed the order on your official portal and applied the payment.
Finally, I received the wrong products (White colour) which I never requested. I placed the ordered only by looking at the pics on your portal.
This is misleading. None of your management is sure about such products and online portal."

In the service bill they mention coolant is changed but shockingly no coolant was added in service. After complaining they have changed it .

"Dear Sir,
With ref. to the above subject I feel I am being cheated being a loyal Maruti Suzuki customer for the last 30 years.
I booked a Maruti Suzuki Jimny Bluish black, Manual Transmission Alfa model on 29 July 2024 by paying rupees 1 lakhs in advance as desired by the dealership, the loan of rupees five lakhs too had been sanctioned on 30 July 2024 whose intimation was sent to Premson Motors Ranchi.by my banker State bank of India through mail.
On repeated follow up with the dealership they failed to communicate the status of the delivery till 31 July 2024.& entertain my calls.
Today I,e 2nd August 2024 they have forced me to take back the refund of my advance money or pay an extra rupees eighty thousand in ( 80000 /-                 ) case I wish to go ahead with my booking of the vehicle,
As a loyal customer & with written commitment from your dealer I feel cheated if I have to pay the extra  rupees eighty thousand in case I wish to go ahead with my booking of the vehicle,
Kindly update me with your understanding in the above case whether the old quoted price holds true for a genuine customer like me or not else I will go ahead buying a different brand of vehicle.
Looking forward for your kind co-operation & early action.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Nikhil Dhiman , and I have completed my diploma in Mechanical Engineering. I am writing to address an issue I have encountered while attempting to apply for positions on your career site.

Upon reviewing the job listings, I noticed that some positions specifically require a diploma qualification. However, during the application process, there is a section requesting graduation details, which presents a challenge for individuals like myself who do not possess a degree. Unfortunately, there isn’t an option available to indicate that the graduation details are not applicable for me, thus hindering my ability to apply for these roles.

I kindly request your assistance in resolving this matter. Addressing this issue would greatly benefit individuals like myself who hold diplomas and are eager to contribute to your esteemed organization.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I am hopeful for a prompt resolution and look forward to your response in comment section"

"Dear Maruti Suzuki Team,

I am a long-standing and loyal customer of Maruti Suzuki, but I am writing to express my deep concern regarding a recent incident involving our Maruti Suzuki car, which is registered under my father’s name and is approximately two years old. On June 7th, 2024, my father, mother, and nephew were involved in a severe accident while driving the car. Unfortunately, despite the severe impact that completely destroyed the car, the airbags failed to deploy, resulting in severe injuries to all three passengers.

This malfunction has raised serious concerns about the safety features of the vehicle and has shaken my trust in Maruti's commitment to customer safety. I kindly request a thorough investigation into this matter and an written explanation of why the airbags did not deploy as expected.

I look forward to your prompt and detailed response. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

"I have bought ertiga vxi car, when I went showroom to receive new car, I found that AC is not working, I told to dealer about this, they sent car to workshop and repair but after one month again same problem, AC gas exhausted. Again I told the complaint to dealer. This time also they repair after dismantling whole roof and other parts. So take the necessary action, why this problem repeat again and again. This is related to your prestige. Dealer is standard Maruti motor cop jabalpur, Madhya pradesh"

" DD MOTORS, RANA JI ENCL. , NANGLI SAKRAWATI, NAJAFGARH DELHI 110043 के ऑथराइज्ड सर्विस सेंटर के स्टाफ और उनके द्वारा किए हुए सर्विस के विषय में शिकायत पत्र। 
नमस्कार सर मेरा नाम विपिन कुमार है, मेरा गाड़ी नंबर यह DL12CN5298 (BALENO) है। मैं 2 जून 24 को यह गाड़ी सर्विस और इंश्योरेंस क्लेम के लिए, इसके बॉडी पार्ट चेंज करवाने के लिए authorized सर्विस सेंटर में दी थी।
इस सर्विस सेंटर का स्टाफ इतना झूठ निकम्मा कामचोर और पब्लिक के बीच में मारुति सुजुकी और डीडी मोटर्स की इतनी इमेज खराब कर दी है इन्होंने इसलिये यहां दोबारा कोई service के लिए आना नहीं चाहेगा।

गाड़ी की इंस्पेक्शन से लेकर सर्विस तक सारा काम इनका है, लेकिन यह पब्लिक को इतना धूप में खड़े होने के बाद पूछते हैं कि क्या-क्या काम करना है,  परेशान करते हैं और उनके serwayer निकम्मे,  घटिया हैं जिनको नॉलेज नहीं है काम की वह लोकल लैंग्वेज में बात करते हैं।

मेरी आपसे यही रिक्वेस्ट है कि मेरी गाड़ी का काम तो इन्होंने इतना लेट कर ही दिया है, लेकिन आप इस स्टाफ के अगेंस्ट कुछ स्ट्रिक्ट एक्शन लीजिए, जिससे मारुति सुजुकी और डीडी मोटर्स की इमेज खराब ना हो।

मेरी गाड़ी की इतनी घटिया कंडीशन देखकर मैं आपकी सर्विस से बहुत डिसेटिस्फाइड हूं और मैं दोबारा कभी भी मारुति के ऑथराइज्ड सर्विस सेंटर में नहीं आना चाहूंगा।

Hi Maruti Team,

I purchased a Maruti Ignis on January 5, 2024, from TR Sawhney Automobiles Pvt Ltd, Sector 29, Gurgaon. My car met with an accident on January 11, 2024, and has been parked at the Nexa workshop in Sector 62, Ullavas, Gurgaon since then.

My car has been sitting in the workshop for five months. The surveyor has rejected my claim, stating that it was because my car was not registered at the time of the accident. If my car was not registered, how was the seller able to hand it over to me without the necessary documents? Moreover, how did I obtain insurance for an unregistered car? I have been paying the EMI for the past five months, and now the workshop is demanding ₹20,000 as parking charges and asking me to take the car back. No one is listening to me. Please arrange for my car to be repaired.

"Maruti Suzuki India Limited Randhir Singh Kalsi  Sanjiv Sinha I own a 2023 Grand Vitara that has only run 10,000 km, and I’m already experiencing issues with the axle. I took it to Maruti Suzuki Magic Auto in Mayapuri, where they acknowledged the problem and noted the part that needs replacement. However, it's been four days, and I'm still waiting for the part to arrive. 

Why is it taking so long? I've attempted to contact level 3, 4, and 5 escalation officers, but they are unreachable. I believe we should bring this matter to the attention of Mr. Hisashi Takeuchi."

"Dear Sir,
With ref. to the above subject I feel I am being cheated being a loyal Maruti Suzuki customer for the last 30 years.
I booked a Maruti Suzuki Jimny Bluish black, Manual Transmission Alfa model on 29 July 2024 by paying rupees 1 lakhs in advance as desired by the dealership, the loan of rupees five lakhs too had been sanctioned on 30 July 2024 whose intimation was sent to Premson Motors Ranchi.by my banker State bank of India through mail.
On repeated follow up with the dealership they failed to communicate the status of the delivery till 31 July 2024.& entertain my calls.
Today I,e 2nd August 2024 they have forced me to take back the refund of my advance money or pay an extra rupees eighty thousand in ( 80000 /-                 ) case I wish to go ahead with my booking of the vehicle,
As a loyal customer & with written commitment from your dealer I feel cheated if I have to pay the extra  rupees eighty thousand in case I wish to go ahead with my booking of the vehicle,
Kindly update me with your understanding in the above case whether the old quoted price holds true for a genuine customer like me or not else I will go ahead buying a different brand of vehicle.
Looking forward for your kind co-operation & early action.

"Have Baleno 2022 Zeta purchased in June-2023 from KD Motors, Bhuj. Within 8 months and 8K KMs noise started from both front wheels. Visited multiple 8+ times for the resolution of the issue but they are not able to fix it and most of the times they don't have parts available. Both suspensions failed and were replaced but even after that the noise issue is not fixed. Requested for full refund and take vehicle but that is also not done. Requested to share escalation matrix many times but they never shared it. Not resolving issue as well as not sharing an escalation matrix to get attention to this issue and fix on priority. Pathetic experience. Doesn't recommend any one to go for Maruti. I was about to go with non-Maruti but then considered Maruti but now regretting my decision."

"Subject: Poor Service Experience with Suzuki Motorbike Service Centers india Delhi 

Dear Suzuki Motorbike Team,

I am writing to express my disappointment and frustration with the service I've received from your authorized service centers. Over the past two months, I've visited multiple centers with issues related to my Suzuki Scooty, but unfortunately, the problems persist.

Despite repeated visits and payments for servicing, the issues remain unresolved. It feels like I'm being taken advantage of, and the service centers are more interested in charging me than providing a solution.

The lack of effective communication, poor diagnosis, and inadequate repairs have led to a significant waste of time and money. As a loyal customer, I expect a higher level of service and support from your team.

I request you to take immediate action to address these issues and ensure that your service centers provide the quality support that customers deserve.
