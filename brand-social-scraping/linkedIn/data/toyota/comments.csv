I'm interested I’ve worked for Honda of America for 24 years and recently moved because of the weather in Ohio. I have tried applying but keep getting turned away from workday. I think I would be a great addition to Toyota because of my knowledge of working in high stress of assembly type work.
Well done
Congratulations!

"1940's when men were at war, ninety percent or more of the nurses, midwives, telephone operators, secretaries, domestic service workers, boarding housekeepers, linen manufacturing, engineering, aircraft manufacture and rope making, were women and made this country strong with disciplined work ethics. You are no different than any one of them. We are glad to have a talent like you in our corner."
I love this so much! You’re awesome Brianna! Thank you for being visible for other women who can absolutely kick butt in your field!
We're so proud and happy to have you Brianna!!

"Brand Strength and Vehicle Strength. Owner of two Tundras— 2008 4.7 and 2010 5.7.  Tough and reliable trucks that just work. Whether it's pulling a trailer with cows or a trailer full of Boy's Scouts camping gear to a summer camp at 8500' elevation, just keep up with maintenance and the truck will get you there.  Congratulations on the AAA+ rating!"
