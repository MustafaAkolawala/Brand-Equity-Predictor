This theme emphasizes collaboration, resilience, and the shared journey toward a better future for all, and was created by R&D team member Diego G.! Learn more about Diego and the inspiration behind this year‚Äôs theme and logo.  ‚ÄúThe inspiration behind my logo came from the word ‚Äòtogether‚Äô. I wanted to maintain the essence of the original TODOS logo while incorporating diverse elements of our Hispanic culture that represented a unified front where all cultures come together here at Toyota. Each part of the logo has symbolic meaning: the guitar for our musical heritage, the sun for our indigenous roots, the empanada for culinary diversity, the soccer ball for our passion, and vibrant textiles for Hispanic artistry. The geometric shapes reflect the fast growth and impact of Hispanic culture in this country.  I‚Äôm originally from Santa Cruz, Bolivia, and I spent most of my life in La Paz until 2009, when I moved to South Carolina. During my time in college, I began to appreciate the importance of embracing my culture in America. I take great pride in representing my Bolivian roots as well as my Latino and Hispanic heritage. This commitment has shaped my desire to support others in achieving their goals while also striving to be the best version of myself‚Äîsomeone others can look up to, just as I did when I was starting my career.  Being part of TODOS R&D chapter allows me to reconnect with my roots through our events and interactions with team members. Through TODOS, we always aim to have purposeful events to network, learn and grow as a community. We spend a large amount of our time at work, so being able to bring a sense of ‚ÄúFamilia‚Äù to the workplace is something that I always look for when planning our events.‚Äù  Join us in celebrating the vibrant traditions, rich history, and incredible contributions of the Hispanic community! #HispanicHeritageMonth #LifeAtToyota #StartYourImpossible """,217,180,14,21,2,6,"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D10AQEqgF90UtsYQQ/image-shrink_1280/image-shrink_1280/0/1728576003070?e=1747486800&v=beta&t=MPwN5YNmuDniOKWmdhlbLcOmRuXlM2TXa4GvSFefoys, https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D10AQH0Bu8Rf8Yz0Q/image-shrink_1280/image-shrink_1280/0/1728576004080?e=1747486800&v=beta&t=OohtdDsTaECAPlZPILbYYJkeEu-kMWy9KgICEF4o4EE"

He‚Äôs worked so hard to get to this point and it‚Äôs a testament of his dedication to his dream and the sport. Even though Korban was born with ulnar dysplasia (an upper arm limb difference), we NEVER called it a disability. It is ‚Äúour normal‚Äù and we never limited him to his disability. He‚Äôs a rookie to the pro-circuit for para track and field, but literally bursting on the scene!  We are deeply grateful for the overwhelming love and support from our Toyota family. The sponsorship marketing team has been exceptional, and their embodiment of the mendomi principle shines through in all their positive energy sent our way. It's truly heartwarming to know that so many have generously taken time from their busy schedules to watch and cheer him on.

This fueled her passion to become an engineer! In celebration of #InternationalWomenInEngineeringDay, Victoria shares more about her journey to becoming a woman in engineer and her #LifeatToyota:  ""My inspiration to become an engineer stemmed from a desire to create solutions that improve everyday life. The opportunity to turn ideas into real, impactful results was incredibly motivating for me. Being a woman engineer has given me a unique perspective and a strong sense of purpose. It has driven me to advocate for diversity and inclusion within the workplace and also made me more empathetic and collaborative in my approach to problem-solving.   My experiences have reinforced the importance of perseverance and adaptability in overcoming obstacles and achieving success. To future women in engineering, I would say: never doubt your abilities and always seek out opportunities to learn and grow. Embrace challenges as they come, and don‚Äôt be afraid to advocate for yourself. Remember that diversity is a strength and your unique perspective is invaluable and can drive innovative solutions.  My favorite part about working for Toyota is the company's unwavering commitment to innovation and continuous improvement. The collaborative culture and emphasis on teamwork and respect for people create a supportive and stimulating work environment. I believe that the future of engineering lies in embracing diverse perspectives and fostering an inclusive environment where everyone can thrive.

That‚Äôs one of the reasons why she feels proud to work at Toyota ‚Äî she‚Äôs doing what she loves. Natalie shares more about her #LifeatToyota and what #PrideMonth means to her:   ""My favorite thing about working for Toyota is the pride I feel when I see a vehicle I helped design out on the road!  Also, Toyota has greatly supported my identity. Among other things, the support we have for the Spectrum BPG, our benefits, and little things like including preferred pronouns in our online communication tools.    To me Pride Month is about acceptance and, not to be overly simplistic, pride. A lot of people have overcome hardships, stress, and more just for being who they are. It‚Äôs a way to celebrate overcoming those struggles and continuing to move forward, in hopes of inspiring courage in others who may still be struggling. It lets others know they are not alone and that . there are people who accept you, support you, and who love you for exactly who you are.   I joined Spectrum as a member a few years ago because I have a sibling and friends who were members of the LGBTQ+ community. Once I felt comfortable identifying publicly as a member of the LGBTQ+ community, I was graciously welcomed by the Toyota North America Spectrum community. At the end of the day, people are people. Every person has value, and we have more in common than we realize.
