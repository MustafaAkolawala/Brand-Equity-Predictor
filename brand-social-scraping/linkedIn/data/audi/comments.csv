Impeccable as usual for Audi

Screens everywhere is lazy design.
Can't wait
When can we expect software updates to help Audi evolve over time?
"A new benchmark in digital comfort and intelligent design. The Audi Q6 Sportback e-tron turns every journey into a connected experience — progressive, premium, and purely electric. ⚡"
"Impressive. 
What prompted the conceptual shift in the dashboard design? 
Was it a matter of rethinking the form factor itself? 
A strategic alignment with evolving design trends—or a deliberate pursuit of enhanced ergonomics, intuitive accessibility, and functional integration of in-vehicle systems?

One could argue that the previous design, which seamlessly blended into the overall interior architecture, offered a more harmonious solution—both visually and functionally.

Take, for example, the dashboard design in the Audi A6, S6, and RS6 models. In my view, it represents, no doubts, a masterpiece in automotive interior design. Its sculptural clarity, ergonomic precision, and cohesive integration with the cabin environment reflect a design philosophy that values both form and function. 
I would say this level of refinement and user-centric thinking has long distinguished Audi in a competitive automotive landscape."

"Als langjähriger Audi vielfahrer kann ich sagen dass die 2,0 TDI nicht die selben eingenschaften wie der V6 TDI bringen kann, mit 2,0 TDI kann ich micht nicht befreunden bin aber optimistisch dass AUDI auf jeden fall einen V6 TDI Motor vorstellen wird, dann wird es sehr interessant und ich hole mir den neuen A6 Avant, fahre momentan den vorgänger S6 Avant bin mehr als zufrieden innerhalb 4 Jahre sind momentan bei 196tkm läuft wie ein Uhrwerk."
I think i'm in Love right now 🙏🏻💪🏻♥️😍 what a masterpiece
Absolut fantastisch
"Als Audi-Kunde bin ich seid mehr als 30 Jahren sehr zufrieden mit den Produkten. Seit 2019 mit dem e-tron, inzwischen mit dem 2. e-tron. Kein Fahrzeug ist so überzeugend wie dieses. Kein Verbrenner wird mich mehr überzeugen können. Irgendwann wird das jeder verstehen."
Wonderschön und gefällt mir

To much BMW and not enough Audi in the design.

As photographer who works with cameras from a different perspective — capturing moments and people rather than data — I’m always fascinated to see how much innovation goes into camera systems for driving. Incredible to think about the precision and responsibility behind these technologies. Excited to follow where this progress leads!
"Sehr coole Kampagne, auch der Rest, den wir im Mynet schon sehen können. Echte Kolleginnen und Kollegen sind einfach was anderes als irgendwelche Models. Weiter so!!

"Sustainability is a complex equation — it’s not just about choosing electric over petrol. ⚡⛽
We need to look deeper: battery production, plastic use, recycling of materials like used tires, and the full lifecycle of a vehicle all play critical roles.

So the real question is: What do we truly want to care about?
Which direction aligns with our values?
And most importantly — what kind of legacy do we want to leave behind on this planet?

Sustainability isn’t a checkbox. It’s a mindset. 🌍♻️"

"Thank you for sharing this insightful update on Audi's upcoming models and the strategic vision for electric mobility.
It's fascinating to see how Audi is balancing innovation in combustion engines with a robust commitment to electric vehicles, ensuring a diverse and adaptable range that caters to different markets and consumer preferences.
Marco Schubert's perspective on the challenges and opportunities ahead, particularly in the context of the evolving global market, is invaluable.
The anticipation surrounding models like the A6 Avant and the A6L e-tron is palpable, and it’s encouraging to witness Audi's plans to meet the future head-on.
I look forward to seeing how these innovations will enhance driving experiences and further solidify Audi's position in the automotive landscape."

I like Audi but not electric. Most Americans feel the same.
Thank you for sharing. I was seeking an update on advancements in optimizing hydrogen fuel cell engines for cars.

"The car deserve a better steering wheel and analog cluster with disappearing monitors for night driving, as been regular for all Audi cars until few years ago. We are driving, not working on a spreadsheet with all monitor estate!!"
Great Car!
"I truly think you should consider re-evaluating the US consumer market for the Avant. You brought the RS6 Avant but that doesn’t truly appeal to the entire market. 

Granted the current economic situation may not be the best time, but I- in addition to many other consumers- would love Avant versions. 

And no we don’t ALL want SUV’s even if they’re compact."
And where is the coupe???
"Schlanke Linie, modern, sportlich. Genau mein Stil."

"675 km…wenn er denn lädt, sollte man vielleicht dazu schreiben.

Mein Q8 Etron hat nach nicht mal zwei Jahren massive Probleme beim Laden. Ständige Abbrüche (6-7 Mal ist keine Seltenheit) oder er fängt erst nach mehrmaligem Versuchen (in der Spitze 14 Versuche und ich hatte nur noch 2 km Restreichweite) damit an.

AUDI AG hat das Problem erkannt, es soll ein Software-Update geben. Erst im Juni, jetzt „wahrscheinlich“ Ende April.

Und bis dahin? Zahlen wir weiter die Leasingrate und AUDI AG und der Händler streiten sich darüber, wer die Kosten für ein Ersatzfahrzeug trägt. Das dauert inzwischen fünf Wochen und ein Ersatzfahrzeug hab ich bis heute nicht.

Beim Fußball gäbe es für Zeitspiel mindestens die gelbe Karte, in so einem Fall müsste man Rot zeigen.

Vorsprung durch Technik? Fehlanzeige…Service am Kunden? Offensichtlich nicht bei AUDI AG 

Leider nur noch traurig. So treibt man die treuen Kunden in die Arme der asiatischen Hersteller.

Was nützt mir ein schönes Auto, wenn die Technik nicht funktioniert.

Was nützt mir ein mehr als 80.000 Euro teures Elektrofahrzeug, wenn es nicht richtig lädt.

AUDI AG , aufwachen…ich bin bald weg. Und dann war das definitiv mein sechster, aber auch letzter Audi."

So beautiful car
This is a silent beast !!!😈
"I’m not a huge car enthusiast, nor do I place much importance on them in my life, and I tend to stay quiet on social media. But the e-tron GT RS really impresses me. Having driven the SUV from its early days, I’m blown away here: the design and driving dynamics are top-notch. Huge respect to the design team—it looks so much better than the Taycan in my opinion (though that’s a matter of taste, of course)! A big thanks also to Ms. Stein from Audi HQ for her quick and professional help with some initial issues—very well handled."
Awesome product 🍀
😍😍
"Wow, Audi AG, you’ve done it again! ⚡ The RS e-tron GT is an absolute masterpiece—those sleek lines, the cutting-edge technology, and that electrifying performance truly embody #VorsprungDurchTechnik. I’m always blown away by Audi’s ability to push the boundaries of design and innovation, and this car is no exception. The futuristic interior, the stunning LED lighting, and the sheer power of this electric beast make my heart race just looking at it!
That said, I have to confess—my all-time favourite Audi remains the A5 Coupe. There’s something about its timeless elegance, the way it claws into the road with Torsen Quattro, and that perfect balance of sportiness and sophistication that stole my heart years ago. It’s been my dream car (dream that came true) ever since I first laid eyes on it, and nothing has quite matched the emotional connection I feel toward it… yet.
But seeing this e-tron GT, I can’t help but wonder if Audi has finally created something that could outshine my beloved A5 Coupe and steal my heart like it did. AUDI AG, how about a challenge? Let me a prolonged test-drive of E-tron GT to prove it’s even better—I’m ready to be amazed and share my emotions with LinkedIn community! 🚗 🎉 😃 "

As a girl it would look nice in a lavender like colour
"The design from Audi is always stylish, there are no two opinions here. EV against ICE is a matter of choice and usage, both have plenty of pros and cons, BUT it's not serious e-tron and id series of VW, not to be able to reach even 80k km before the invertor seal to leave the chat and give to the expression of ""mix the water with the oil"", new sense...Engineering quality guys - take little bit more from the marketing and accountancy people and give it to the engineering people, because the quality from 15 years ago, now is just a mirage..."

"AUDI AG „Striking bold proportions to take you further.“ 

Who is writing and endorsing such a nonsense? 
Are you seriously addressing your potential customers or is this only for internal satisfaction?"
The Audi SQ6 e-tron’s efficiency is impressive. Have you considered how its design might influence urban mobility trends?
What does SUV confidence actually mean?

Why ist the navigation map still lagging in 2025?
Would be nice if Audi would improve its service. Got once inzo the trap where I bought used vehicle from Audi officials as unbroken and then realised that it had broken back and front.
The workplace you are looking for is the Software Development Center at Audi. Find out more about it >> https://www.audi.com/en/careers/professionals/areas-of-focus/audi-software-development-center/ or ask Dani Kobel from the SDC directly.
Please make what sells and not what nihilistic zealots dictate! Drop net zero bs and make German automotive industry great again! God help us throughout theses uncertain times!
As a thought: featuring shrinking top- and bottom-line figures for 2024 is not enticing for the future.

"Dear Audi, once upon a time there must have been thousands of companies making horse carriages. And I bet that the last company around made the best horse carriage you ever saw. How would you like to be a shareholder in that company? Take increasing market share of a shrinking market, sure but slow, down the tube. If one word come to my mind it's obsolescence. China rocks!"

"Vorsprung durch Technik - Das war einmal!

AUDI AG in particular now needs graduates to bring brainpower in the area of IT, Electronic & Software as the very survival of the company depends on it. Its vehicles software suffer from many acknowledged bugs. A 'millennium bug': When an Audi reaches 1000 hours of use an Electronic Attack occurs. Planned Obsolescence!?
The hours before 1000 are counted in hrs & min. After 1000 hours only in hours. Too few digits?

At first the Volkswagen Group tried to address the manifold software problems by firing the entire CARIAD management. But then they repeated the mistake by appointing managers from within!
At Ford they were smart enough to higher a former VP from Apple. In other words someone who DOES have a clue about electronics.
Very good that AUDI AG now seeks smart young graduates to join. However, this may not bring a solution to the problem fast enough.

The race that is now running whether US & Chinese car manufactures can LEARN to build good chassis & car interiors, faster than #VW / #Audi can LEARN to build good software. Whoever wins that races will lead the car industry.

High time for Audi/VW to wake up. Customers are very dissatisfied and happy to leave: https://lnkd.in/epVQuJVw

"Dear AUDI AG  AG and Super Auto Group  (Rabat, Morocco), 
I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally raise a serious concern regarding the alignment issues with my vehicle, which arose after repairs were arranged by Super Auto (Rabat, Morocco), an authorized Audi service center.  
Super Auto sent my vehicle to an external workshop for repairs, and it was after these repairs that the alignment issues occurred. The attached documents contain detailed technical measurements of the front and rear axle alignment, including camber and thrust angle (Angle de poussée). These measurements clearly indicate significant misalignment issues, particularly with the rear wheels, which pose a serious safety risk, especially when navigating turns.  
As Super Auto arranged for these repairs, I hold your agency fully responsible for the resulting defects. I trusted your agency to maintain the highest standards of service, but this situation has caused significant inconvenience and safety concerns.  
I urge you to take full responsibility for this matter and provide a concrete plan to resolve the issue immediately. Please treat this as a formal request to restore my vehicle to a safe and drivable condition at no additional cost to m"

"There is a fineline between over screenification and usability. Screens are also not the replacement for design and luxary.

The current A3/S3/RS3 interior strike such a great balance between design, technology and usability. It’s beautiful, and that’s luxury - the freedom of being frustration-free when operating a vehicle, especially after a stressful day in the office, and in traffic.

I hope Audi / VW will be able to balance this further in their future models 🫡"

Examine https://seatbridge.eu/  it should be very interesting for someone who wants to offer ""seat++Cutting-edge"". Anyway, congratulations !"
"Ich bin leider von meinem aktuellen A6 (C8) sehr enttäuscht, er knarzt und kracht aus allen Ecken, der Fahrassistent ist teils echt gefährlich wenn er mal wieder trotz blinken nicht die Spur wechseln will, das Getriebe mit seinen anfahrprobleme ist alles andere als dynamisch, die Kofferraum Klappe die mir zwar in die Wand kracht, aber gleichzeitig bei einem höheren Bordstein nicht auf geht. Die Liste meiner gefunden Fehler ist schier unendlich. Das ist definitiv mein schlechtester Audi den ich je hatte. Habe immer noch meinen ersten Wagen, einen Audi A3 8L in der Garage, selbst der ist für seine Zeit noch besser verarbeitet.
Ich als Aufi Liebhaber und einst KFZ Mechatroniker Lehrling bei Audi, ich als bekennender Audi Fan, der über andere Marken schimpft 🫡, hoffe das Audi sich fangen wird, sonst wird der neue Wagen den ich mir im September holen werden, kein Audi mehr.
Gruß an alle Audi Fans"

"Audi AG - First and foremost a huge thank you for keeping the A6 as a fossil fuel car - for myself, whom has been driving A6 since the Boer War the view to an A6 only being an EV was unbearable. And yes also thank you for revisiting your ""EV only"" approach and providing an old grumpy petrol head with the opportunity to still drive (not just being transported) in style. Looking forward to laying my hands on my next A6. 😄 "

Unfortunately, for an estate car, the trunk volume is clearly too small - not to say ridiculous - at around 500 liters when the rear seat bench is not folded down. What good is an - undoubtedly beautiful - design & innovation if the practicality and suitability for everyday use are inadequate? Comparable estate cars from the same product class/category, such as the BMW 5 Series or the Mercedes E-Class, have a significantly higher trunk volume, as do vehicles from the same company/group, such as the Skoda Superb IV, the Skoda Octavia IV, the VW Passat B9 or the VW Golf 8 Variant. In some cases, even the hybrid versions of these vehicles - in which the batteries take up a lot of space - still have so much storage space and room. This is simply not acceptable for a vehicle such as the Audi A6 Avant - as a pure combustion engine. The motto must finally be: Less chic and useless gimmicks, and more real cars again!"
"Für einen Kombi leider ein deutlich zu geringes - um nicht gar zu sagen lächerliches - Kofferraumvolumen mit gerundet 500l bei nicht umgeklappter Rücksitzbank. Was nützt einem - ein zweifelsohne schönes - Design & Innovation, wenn die Praktikabilität und Alltagstauglichkeit  nur unzureichend vorhanden sind? Vergleichbare Kombis aus derselben Produktklasse/ Kategorie, wie z. B. der BMW 5er oder die Mercedes E-Klasse besitzen ein deutlich höheres Kofferraumvolumen genauso wie Fahrzeuge aus dem eigenen Hause/ Konzern, wie bspw. der Skoda Superb IV, der Skoda Octavia IV, der VW Passat B9 oder der VW Golf 8 Variant. Teilweise haben selbst die Hybrid-Varianten dieser Fahrzeuge - bei denen die Batterien sehr viel Platz wegnehmen - noch so viel Stauraum und Platzangebot. Das ist für ein solches Fahrzeug, wie den Audi A6 Avant - als reinen Verbrenner - schlichtweg nicht akzeptabel. Das Motto muss endlich wieder lauten: Weniger Schickimicki und nutzlose Spielereien, dafür wieder mehr echtes Autos!"
Il single frame lo avrei fatto più grande !
Deze doorontwikkeling lijkt me zeer geslaagd!
"Sehr schönes Auto! Kann es kaum abwarten, ihn bei uns live im Autohaus zu sehen 😍 "
"500 liters of trunk space (with the rear seat bench not folded down) is an absolute declaration of bankruptcy for this vehicle size... 

Almost all vehicles in the same category, as well as the Passat and the Superb from the same company, show how to do it right"

"It’s 9/10. 
Two comments 

The drivers side has no real
Door handle , when you close there are function buttons , so when you close your hand will also clamp onto those function buttons.  I feel that is poor erognomics, as sone buttons will be activated . 

The second more minor adjusting the climate controls maybe prove awkward as you appear to have a shelf in the way . Minor ergonomic design fault."

"Very nice car! 
(Too bad it is not fiscally attractive as a professional car in Belgium.)
I thought the electric series got an even number and the series with a combustion engine an odd number? Isn't the name confusing with the A6 e-tron no?"

"You had our Audi repaired in an unsafe and unhealthy manner. #67ZK608

Ray Sigorta, Audi Turkey, Doğuş Otomotiv, all #insurance companies, and #automotive authorized services should not have the right to carry out fraudulent and defective repairs, putting our #LifeSafety at #Risk – they do not have this right.

Based on the technical inspections and evaluations I had conducted (documented in reports), my #Audi has been fraudulently and unsafely repaired. As those responsible, you have completely disregarded life safety, performing defective repairs that pose a threat to me and others in traffic, potentially leading to victimization.

I am leaving a record here; in the event of an incident, a document archive has been created to be presented to the relevant parties. This situation is unacceptable both legally and ethically. I demand that those responsible take accountability and provide a proper resolution. If no corrective action is taken, I will continue to pursue all necessary legal steps and publicly expose this negligence.

Traffic safety is not a matter to be taken lightly, and I refuse to accept a vehicle that puts both my life and the lives of others at risk. Any potential accidents or malfunctions caused by this faulty rep"

Furthermore, achieving net carbon neutrality across all production sites is an impressive milestone under the Mission:Zero program.

"أسوأ تجربة مع أودي: إهمال، وعود كاذبة، وانتظار لا ينتهي
لطالما كانت أودي علامة فارقة في عالم السيارات الفاخرة، لكن تجربتي معها أثبتت أن الاسم وحده لا يكفي لضمان الجودة والخدمة الراقية. بدأت القصة عندما قررت شراء أودي Q8 Limited Edition من الوكيل في الرياض، حيث كنت أتوقع تجربة استثنائية تتماشى مع سمعة الشركة، لكن ما حدث كان العكس تمامًا—إهمال، عدم اهتمام، ووعود كاذبة امتدت لأشهر طويلة دون أي حل حقيقي.
البداية الصادمة
عند شراء السيارة، فوجئت بإرسالها إلى منزلي على ناقلة دون أي طلب مني، وكأن الهدف كان إغلاق الصفقة بأسرع وقت ممكن دون احترام تجربة العميل. الأكثر استغرابًا هو أنني لم أتسلم إلا مفتاحًا واحدًا، على الرغم من أنني طلبت المفتاح الثاني مرارًا وتكرارًا لعدة أشهر، وحتى اليوم لم أستلمه!
مشاكل متكررة منذ الأسبوع الأول
لم يمضِ سوى أسبوع على استخدامي للسيارة حتى بدأت المشاكل بالظهور—أعطال في المصابيح الأمامية والخلفية، ورسائل تحذير في النظام، مما جعلني أعود بها فورًا إلى الوكالة. هذه الأعطال غير مقبولة في سيارة جديدة، لكنني كنت ما زلت أملك بعض الثقة في أن المشكلة سيتم حلها سريعًا.

The front wing will reduce drag ,Cw-wert when making  turbulence before the vehicle is similar like the vehicle moves after another vehicle with high speed. The front wings will cut the front airflow like taran."

Cred ca in realitate aceasta masina arata mult mai bine . Sper sa fie și-n varianta cu motorizare pe benzina de 3 l si distribuție pe lanț & cel mai performant sistem quattro .

fine.. but I expect there to be a diesel and petrol version and we won't just be playing with electric cars.
Amazing car!

"I'm finally ready to order a brand new a6 e-tron.
But yesterday grid blackout in Portugal 🇵🇹 is making me reconsider.
How can a 100k€ car have no support for V2L in 2025?
Such a massive battery could have powered our fridge and microwave for hours.
Yet, no support for V2L or V2H. not even a simple 230v socket available in the car trunk.
With several other OEM offering this more than required feature, I would love to know what are audi plan to address this concern?
Is this something you will add to your vehicles this year?"

"Many Audi e-trons suffer catastrophic failures when their coolant floods the electric motor, rendering the vehicle unusable. Despite this recurring fault, Audi systematically refuses to provide warranty cover, forcing owners to pay for costly repairs (up to several thousand euros). This attitude, considered dishonest, could lead to a drop in perceived reliability and sales, with customers turning to competitors such as Tesla. The problem could also affect other models (Q4 e-tron, Q7 e-tron). Audi must recognise this shortcoming and propose solutions, or risk losing the confidence of its customers for good. I am a victim of this problem and have contacted AUDI's various customer services departments on several occasions, but they do not respond and completely ignore the problem. This attitude is disgraceful and should be punished, which I will do my best to do!"

"""Ice is the new frontier—where engineering meets the elements.""

Glaciers are nature’s proving grounds, and machines like this are a testament to human ingenuity—pushing the limits where grip is a luxury and precision is survival.

Every curve, every drift, every controlled slide on ice is not just about speed; it's about mastering forces beyond our control. That’s where true engineering shines.

Audi’s red beast on ice? That’s not just a car—it’s a statement.

This is great
"RS6. Sportback is turrible. RS 3 is fun, S5 Avant, doesn't have any soul that the classic and rebranded RS cars have.   

I've love to see a a real Audi EV  running on a Lucid or something that has the range befitting the costs,  powertrain. 400 miles is the minimum. Otherwise we need to own a TDI or Hybrid as well.  Okay okay sure 400 mile range, with 10-15min max for charging to 80% (but remember my TDI can do 650 miles on the tank), but since I can't without stopping, I don't need 650, but I need 400 and fast charging.

BTW the Q6 stole elements from the X5 and others.  It's not Audi. Throwing a big mouth on these cars, BMW /Toyota included, does not make your car unique, so please stop this!!"

whats the premium price for?  Oh yes an electric motor and a battery the same as all other EVs no wonder they are losing so much money!

Integrating smart diagnostics with the myAudi app marks a shift toward data-driven servicing, reducing downtime and improving longevity.

"Sorry but in general I think that EV market is not a way to follow. I am a fan of the brand but I really hope that managers and R&D can choose other marketing strategies and get out from this fight against brands to achieve the “performance” talking about cars that nobody wants. 

Some friends of mine took 2 days to go from Hungary to Spain on holiday. Each way. With a Tesla. Do you think it’s normal? 

I think that a brand like Audi can stay out from this market and go on producing amazing cars as usual. But no EV / plug in or that kind of thing. Please. Thanks."
A 423km range on the Q4 40 e-tron sounds impressive and certainly addresses range anxiety concerns for everyday driving.
