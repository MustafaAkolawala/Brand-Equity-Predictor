Ford Motor Co."" || Henry Ford was considered ""evil"" to Leland, particularly Henry M. Leland, because Ford essentially forced Leland out of his own company, the Lincoln Motor Company, after acquiring it, effectively ending Leland's legacy with the brand he founded, and doing so with a sense of vindictiveness stemming from a past business rivalry where Leland had previously been involved in forcing Ford out of his own company years earlier; this left Leland with little control over the future of Lincoln, which he had poured his heart into creating. || TIL in 1963 Robert Kearns invented the intermittent windshield wiper, presented it to Ford Motor Co. and was hired.

My name is Nilson César Munhoz da Silva, from Brazil and I am the owner of a 2020 Mustang that experienced a premature transmission failure at 22,000 km and, more recently, a complete engine failure (rod knock) at 28,000 km. I took the vehicle to the Ford Sinal dealership in São Caetano do Sul, where the transmission had previously been replaced, and I was informed that the engine had “desbielado” (thrown a rod), with no explanation for such a serious issue in a vehicle with such low mileage.

The transmission replacement was carried out at the dealership, and I covered all the costs myself, even though it is widely known that this Mustang model has a history of recurring transmission problems. There are numerous reports of similar issues in the United States, including recalls.

Although the second full service was not performed, all essential maintenance, such as oil and filter changes, was carried out at the same dealership. I would like to emphasize that regular maintenance does not involve opening the engine or transmission for internal inspection. Therefore, the absence of a full service would not have prevented these premature failures.

My question is: what exactly would a complete service have done differently to prevent these failures? The necessary basic maintenance was performed at an authorized dealership.

I contacted Ford’s customer service line (0800), and the concierge, Gabriela, mediated the communication between me and the company. However, Ford refused to repair the vehicle or offer any reasonable agreement.

It is unacceptable that a premium car of this value experiences such severe failures in both the engine and transmission with such low mileage. I expect a fair and responsible solution, considering the high cost of the vehicle and the quality that the brand should guarantee."

I know this is a long shot and you probably won’t see this but I was hoping and praying that you could possibly help me with something. 

I’m a single Mom to my daughter, Sirinity. She’s 14 and a bright student. 

 Over the summer I had car issues like many others and had to replace my transmission. 3 weeks later the car went out again. The engine needs to be replaced. While I wanted to keep this car and pay it off to gift it to my daughter once she came of age I’ve had to put over $8000 dollars in repairs and I’m still paying a note on this car and have to carry full insurance! 

This money spent I was saving up for our first home! 

 I owe $4300 dollars and asking if at all possible can you cover it for me so I no longer have to bare that burden. 

 I went out to get another car so I’m currently paying two car notes and insurances. Please help in anyway. You’d be a real blessing Thank you!!! ☺️ || It's funny how you put our beautiful women of color on display when you have eliminated You're a diversity equity and inclusion programs which affect those same people you're trying to capture in your ads!

componente do meu carro que é devidamente comprovado que se trata de um defeito de fabricação da ford, e mesmo com isso explícito de tal forma,
a empresa (ford) não tem o mínimo de sensibilidade com o consumidor final (pós venda) para expor uma solução de fácil acesso e que tenha o mínimo de
impacto favorável a reduzir a péssima experiência de pós venda do consumidor.

Por fim, sei que essa pesquisa não irá me ajudar em nada, não irá mudar nada, mas ao menos servirá de um desabafo.

I own a Ford Bronco, a vehicle that recently faced serious issues with its rear axle, affecting traction among other crucial functions. Given the severity of the issue and the fact my car was still under warranty, I decided to take it to the @viaforveiculos dealership in my town (Brazil - Vitoria). There, I was personally greeted by Douglas Ferreira, the customer relationship manager, who assured me he would take care of everything. I must admit, initially skeptical due to past experiences with the after-sales service of other manufacturers, I was surprised by his promise of a solution and support.

Douglas not only ensured a loaner car to minimize my inconvenience but also maintained constant and transparent communication throughout the entire process. My car had to stay in the dealership for approximately 35 days, waiting for the necessary parts to arrive. During this period, I received frequent updates on the repair status, demonstrating a level of customer follow-up and attention that was truly remarkable.

This experience not only increased my appreciation for ViaFor but also renewed my confidence in @ford as a brand. The quality of service and care I received has led me to consider purchasing a new vehicle from the same dealership in the future.

Indeed, the car was under warranty, and one could argue that good service is expected. However, what I experienced went beyond expectations, surpassing mere obligation and providing a sense of tranquility in what could have been an extremely stressful moment.

A special thank you to Douglas and the entire ViaFor team for the exceptional service. You transformed a potential problem into a memorable experience of satisfaction and trust. || T2 || 🔥🔥"
