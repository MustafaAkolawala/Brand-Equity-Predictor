https://www.instagram.com/ford/,"Bill Stroppe, welcome to the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America.

Ford and the Stroppe family have been working together since the 1950s, when Bill raced Lincoln vehicles in Mexico. Bill’s involvement with the Ford Bronco® would then begin in 1965, when he raced pre-production models in California.

But the real breakthrough came in 1969, when the Stroppe Racing Bronco won the Baja 1000, becoming the first and only 4x4 vehicle to be crowned overall winner. 

In 1971, the newly christened “Stroppe Baja Bronco” Package went on sale. Each U15 model purchased through Ford was sent to the Stroppe facility for a full off-road performance upgrade, including its now-iconic blue, white and orange makeover. 

Around 650 original Stroppe Bronco vehicles were delivered between 1971 and 1975, making it a very rare beast.

Over the years, Ford and Stroppe have taken countless victory laps together, with the latest collaboration being the 2025 Bronco Stroppe Special Edition Package.

Bill Stroppe sadly passed away in 1995 as an icon of racing. This week, as he rightfully takes his place in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America, we’d like to congratulate the entire Stroppe Racing family for this amazing achievement.

Ford, check your stats on Mustang sales before and after you locked the ECUs. || @zarbex 😢 ||  || I wish to sit behind the wheel for once 🥺😍👑 || Why is the video 1 hour long? || Premature Transmission and Engine Failure in Mustang 2020 — Lack of Support from Ford

My name is Nilson César Munhoz da Silva, from Brazil and I am the owner of a 2020 Mustang that experienced a premature transmission failure at 22,000 km and, more recently, a complete engine failure (rod knock) at 28,000 km. I took the vehicle to the Ford Sinal dealership in São Caetano do Sul, where the transmission had previously been replaced, and I was informed that the engine had “desbielado” (thrown a rod), with no explanation for such a serious issue in a vehicle with such low mileage.

The transmission replacement was carried out at the dealership, and I covered all the costs myself, even though it is widely known that this Mustang model has a history of recurring transmission problems. There are numerous reports of similar issues in the United States, including recalls.

Although the second full service was not performed, all essential maintenance, such as oil and filter changes, was carried out at the same dealership. I would like to emphasize that regular maintenance does not involve opening the engine or transmission for internal inspection. Therefore, the absence of a full service would not have prevented these premature failures.

My question is: what exactly would a complete service have done differently to prevent these failures? The necessary basic maintenance was performed at an authorized dealership.

I contacted Ford’s customer service line (0800), and the concierge, Gabriela, mediated the communication between me and the company. However, Ford refused to repair the vehicle or offer any reasonable agreement.

It is unacceptable that a premium car of this value experiences such severe failures in both the engine and transmission with such low mileage. I expect a fair and responsible solution, considering the high cost of the vehicle and the quality that the brand should guarantee."

I know this is a long shot and you probably won’t see this but I was hoping and praying that you could possibly help me with something. 

I’m a single Mom to my daughter, Sirinity. She’s 14 and a bright student. 

 Over the summer I had car issues like many others and had to replace my transmission. 3 weeks later the car went out again. The engine needs to be replaced. While I wanted to keep this car and pay it off to gift it to my daughter once she came of age I’ve had to put over $8000 dollars in repairs and I’m still paying a note on this car and have to carry full insurance! 

This money spent I was saving up for our first home! 

 I owe $4300 dollars and asking if at all possible can you cover it for me so I no longer have to bare that burden. 

 I went out to get another car so I’m currently paying two car notes and insurances. Please help in anyway. You’d be a real blessing Thank you!!! ☺️ || It's funny how you put our beautiful women of color on display when you have eliminated You're a diversity equity and inclusion programs which affect those same people you're trying to capture in your ads!

Levei o carro na ford no mês passado e me informaram que encontraram o defeito e tomei conhecimento que é um defeito pré existente no câmbio, cobriram o primeiro protocolo aberto e quando foram trocar as peças cobertas semana passada identificaram outras peças que teriam que trocar e enviram para a ford e os mesmos negaram. Sem trocar as peças o carro não pode nem andar, inclusive o mesmo ficou na ford até o prezado momento, pois falaram que tem risco de aquecimento e o mesmo parar de funcionar a qualquer momento. As peças que precisam trocar representam 25% do valor do carro, um valor extremamente caro que não tenho condições de pagar, liguei no 0800 e simplesmente me deixaram sem nenhum informação ou sem saber o que fazer. Preciso de um retorno e uma reavaliação pois caso mantenha essa negativa terei que entrar na justiça pois é de conhecimento da empresa que esse defeito é pré existente e a mesma não repassa essa informação, descobri por terceiros por mera coincidência e estou sendo lesada pela empresa.

Considero tal ato imoral e leviano por parte da empresa, pois os mesmos tem conhecimento de tal defeito e não repassam essa informação e agora negam a cobertura das peças com defeito. || The electric truck is nice but the battery life needs to be better || 🔥 || @ford your ac compressor issues for brand new 2o24 truck should be known.

Actualmente mi padre en Venezuela tiene un Mustang de mil novecientos sesenta y nueve y está restaurando uno de mil novecientos setenta ha montado un bloque grande de 351 Cleveland que ha hecho modificaciones de locuras. Aún está en proceso yo actualmente vivo en España y trabajo ahora con otro tipo de coches pero mi sueño siempre ha sido restaurar verdaderos coches.

I know this is a long shot and you probably won’t see this but I was hoping and praying that you could possibly help me with something. 

I’m a single Mom to my daughter, Sirinity. She’s 14 and a bright student. 

 Over the summer I had car issues like many others and had to replace my transmission. 3 weeks later the car went out again. The engine needs to be replaced. While I wanted to keep this car and pay it off to gift it to my daughter once she came of age I’ve had to put over $8000 dollars in repairs and I’m still paying a note on this car and have to carry full insurance! 

This money spent I was saving up for our first home! 

 I owe $4300 dollars and asking if at all possible can you cover it for me so I no longer have to bare that burden. 

 I went out to get another car so I’m currently paying two car notes and insurances. Please help in anyway. You’d be a real blessing Thank you!!! ☺️ || @ford I have a 2019 ford ranger and I’ve had to replace the transmission 3 times already and it’s going out again.
