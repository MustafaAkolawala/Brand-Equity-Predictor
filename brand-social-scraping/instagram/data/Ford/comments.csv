F ford. Their executive yelled at a couple in a wheelchair for watching Fox News and being a Trump supporter. Who supports your company ford? Maybe the hardworking farmers who voted for Trump. Maybe the majority of Americans who voted for Trump. Remove this executive or cancel

What's going on with Ford Jalisco? Why does a teenager has a client truck and when the owner complains he gets threatened?
Ford 🔥
"Ford was considered ""evil"" to the Dodge brothers primarily because Henry Ford, in a power move, stopped paying dividends to shareholders, including the Dodge brothers, who owned a significant stake in Ford, to reinvest profits back into the company instead, effectively hindering their ability to fund their own growing car company, Dodge, which was seen as a direct competitor to Ford; this ultimately led to a legal battle between the two companies known as ""Dodge v. Ford Motor Co."""
"TIL in 1963 Robert Kearns invented the intermittent windshield wiper, presented it to Ford Motor Co. and was hired. Ford fired him and took his technology. He sued Ford for patent infringement and after 12 yrs. of litigation, at times without a lawyer, the court awarded Kearns 10.3 M dollars."

Ford Ecoboost systems is defective and no recall. Shame on Ford.. 7000 bill
"O que foi realizado pela Ford para com os consumidores brasileiros proprietários de carros com o câmbio Power shift foi de uma total falta de respeito.
O acesso a informação sobre a garantia do veículo é quase que sigiloso, como mencionado acima estou a mais de uma semana tentando uma garantia de um
componente do meu carro que é devidamente comprovado que se trata de um defeito de fabricação da ford, e mesmo com isso explícito de tal forma,
a empresa (ford) não tem o mínimo de sensibilidade com o consumidor final (pós venda) para expor uma solução de fácil acesso e que tenha o mínimo de
impacto favorável a reduzir a péssima experiência de pós venda do consumidor.

Por fim, sei que essa pesquisa não irá me ajudar em nada, não irá mudar nada, mas ao menos servirá de um desabafo.
Meu sonho sempre foi ter um ford focus, comprei com muito sacrifício, fruto de muito trabalho honesto,
tendo que muitas vezes sacrificar o tempo de convívio com minha família. Sempre fui um admirador da ford,
e de fato a ford se tornou a maior decepção da minha vida.

Ass: Um proprietário de um carro que foi um sonho um dia, e hoje é um pesadelo diário."

best car? mercury
Great car and great ad. Good luck finding one MSRP at a dealer that doesn’t play games with customer. I’d gladly buy direct 😞

"O que foi realizado pela Ford para com os consumidores brasileiros proprietários de carros com o câmbio Power shift foi de uma total falta de respeito.
O acesso a informação sobre a garantia do veículo é quase que sigiloso, como mencionado acima estou a mais de uma semana tentando uma garantia de um
componente do meu carro que é devidamente comprovado que se trata de um defeito de fabricação da ford, e mesmo com isso explícito de tal forma,
a empresa (ford) não tem o mínimo de sensibilidade com o consumidor final (pós venda) para expor uma solução de fácil acesso e que tenha o mínimo de
impacto favorável a reduzir a péssima experiência de pós venda do consumidor.

Por fim, sei que essa pesquisa não irá me ajudar em nada, não irá mudar nada, mas ao menos servirá de um desabafo.
Meu sonho sempre foi ter um ford focus, comprei com muito sacrifício, fruto de muito trabalho honesto,
tendo que muitas vezes sacrificar o tempo de convívio com minha família. Sempre fui um admirador da ford,
e de fato a ford se tornou a maior decepção da minha vida.

Ass: Um proprietário de um carro que foi um sonho um dia, e hoje é um pesadelo diário."

"@drivezone_online Colleagues, it would be nice if you added this beauty to the game"

خدایا چه میشه یکیش ما سوار بشیم
electric cars have no soul
@benlabrot look familiar?
Lol no thanks 😂
"Im a Mustang guy . I’d love one of these as my 2nd car to my GT .
But I don’t want electric . If this was a 4 cylinder or a V6 . I’d buy one all day"
@xrayray122 don’t trust it . Don’t hold value . I’ve worked in several dealerships . Electric cars always come back the most with problems and not turning on
@lun4tik1021 is it just with ford ? I’ve been plenty of them with 400k on the car and still run really good
@xrayray122 nope . Worked for several different brands . And again don’t hold value . They drop half value in less than a year . And 400k miles seems high
Have a 24 Mach E rally and it’s a blast to drive 🔥
Well the color is right ....🤢🤮

"I bought my Ford Bronco almost 3 months ago. All of a sudden it did not want to turn on at all. It would say “no key detected”. Even though I had the key fab in my hand. It’s been 3 days and still cannot figure out what is wrong with my Bronco. Has anyone come across this issue before? We are at a loss here, I don’t understand how a brand new vehicle will not start. 😔"
Nothing else matters BRING BACK THE TERMINATOR.. EVERYONE WILL GO CRAZY
Awesome
Amazing🔥🔥
absolute PEACE
Nobody ever won? This was all a joke? I took it so serious 😭😭😂
"But you are gorgeous, and I love your acting❤️❤️❤️❤️"
I’m gonna stick with my Camaro no ZL1 and buying another one since that one got crushed by a 20-year-old on his phone I don’t want a Mustang lol

@ford I have a 2019 ford ranger and I’ve had to replace the transmission 3 times already and it’s going out again. Do you put bad transmissions in all your trucks or just mine?
"If only you checked quality before they left the factory. I’ve owned many fords over the years, in the past 5 years quality has been sad to say the least."

First experience with toggle autonomous changing lanes with #fordbluecruise
If you can’t tell if you are in middle of lane you don’t need to be driving
Beautiful ❤

Why not just take the effin' bus if you find driving so difficult?
Hands free is perfect while you’re broken down on side of road. You guys should just start making sneakers people that own fords are used to walking.
"I got sold on the Blue Cruise and after I got my truck @ford said sorry, doesn’t work on the Raptor. Also got sold on the OTA updates and I have never received one on my 2021 truck and nobody knows why."
